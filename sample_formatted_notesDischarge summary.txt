Chief Complaint: benadryl overdose, anaphylaxis
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110411**]
is a 29 y/o male with a history of an anaphylactic reaction about a month after he ate a pasta dish at
[**Last Name (un) **], who presents with symptoms of a benadryl overdose after another anaphylactic reaction.  
For his first anaphylactic reaction he was treated as an outpatient at
[**Hospital1 2177**] urgent and sent home on a prednisone burst and benadryl.  
He was seen in allergy as an outpatient and at that time it was recommended that he undergo allergy testing after determining the ingredients in the sauce, however he never followed up.  
Today he again had lunch at
[**Last Name (un) **]
, he had a different pasta dish but after lunch developed hives and throat scratching.  
He took 50mg of benadryl, but his symptoms continued to worsen, and when his boss found him he was somnolent and he called 911.  
Per the patient he thinks he blacked out, he does remember EMS coming he was given epipen, 50mg IV benadryl and 2mg of narcan with no improvement, so he was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ER.
In the ED, initial VS were: 63, 138/98, 16, 100% on NRB, he was initially responsive to sternal rub, but always able to breath on his own.  
He was given 125mg of solumedrol and 20mg of famotidine.  
A CT of his head did not show any abnormaliities and his CXR did not show any evidence of infection.  
His mental status continued to improve during his ER stay, and he became awake and able to answer all questions.  
However, given his presentation there was concern about an overdose so toxicology was consulted.  
His blood and urine tox screens were negative but his EKG showed a QRS complex of 120ms
so he was given 1amp of bicarb and his QRS duration shortened to 100ms,
so he was started on a bicarb gtt for presumed benadryl overdose and admitted to the ICU.
VS on transfer: 98, 95, 20, 138/69, 99% on 2LNC.
On arrival to the MICU pt currently only complaining of pain on the roof of his mouth when he swallows.

INDICATION:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old with sudden mental status changes, history of subdural hemorrhage.
TECHNIQUE:
CT of the brain without IV contrast.
Comparison is made to non-contrast CT performed at 3:00 a.m. today at
[**Hospital1 18**] 
[**Location (un) 620**].
FINDINGS:
Again seen is a subdural hemorrhage extending along the right parietal and temporal lobe convexities and extending into the middle cranial fossa.
This measures 6 mm in greatest dimension over the right parietal lobe and is unchanged from the prior examination.
No new hemorrhages identified.
There is no new hydrocephalus.
There have been no other changes in the seven-hour interval.
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma.
Findings were discussed at approximately 11:00 a.m. with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3271**].
Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service.
She initially required Dopamine in the Emergency room because of hypotension following administration of sedative for agitation.
Once stabilized she was transferred to the Trauma ICU for close monitoring.
Her Dopamine was weaned off the following day and her blood pressures have remained stable.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of her right SDH; this injury was nonoperative.
She was loaded with Dilantin which will need to continue for a total of 7 days.
Serial head CT scans were performed and were stable.
Her Dilantin dose was decreased from 100 mg po tid to 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **]
because felt may be contributing to confusion given level of 17; although therapeutic, in elderly patients this level may be toxic.
She will follow up with Neurosurgery in 6 weeks for repeat head imaging.
Cardiology was also consulted to rule out cardiac causes of her fall; her troponin level was flat; junctional rhythm on ECG felt may be secondary to CNS event.
No clinical evidence of heart failure or tamponade noted.
Serial ECG's were performed (see pertinent results); she remained on telemetry with no recorded events.
Geriatrics was also consulted because of her age and mechanism of injury; several recommendations were made pertaining to her medications.
It was recommended that she be placed on prn Ativan given her alcohol consumption (EtOH level 19 on admission) and Seroquel at hs prn.
She did initially require a 1:1 sitter and this was eventually discontinued.  
Pt was alert although remained slightly confused but easily redirectable for the remainder of her hospitalization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 61-year-old gentleman who initially presented in
[**2152-11-23**] with back, and abdominal pain, and fevers.
He was discharged subsequent to that and was treated on an outpatient basis with ciprofloxacin for question prostatitis. 
He continued to have pain and eventually had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen which showed a 7-cm left pericolic abscess and thickening of the splenic flexure.
He was admitted to the hospital upon discovering this in 
[**2152-12-24**] and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  
He underwent computed tomography-guided drainage of the abscess collection that grew out enterococcus in two strains; of which one was vancomycin resistant.
One month following (on
[**2153-2-1**])
, he again noticed abdominal pain with chills and cramping with emesis.  
He had a follow-up computed tomography which demonstrated another abscess adjacent to the previously drained collection was noted on repeat computed tomography done at this time.  
He was admitted to the hospital and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics consisting of levofloxacin and Flagyl and scheduled for percutaneous drainage of the second collection. 
Of note, the patient had grown vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from the prior collection that was drained in 
[**Month (only) 404**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  
Status post angioplasty times two.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hypertension.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Glucophage 1000 mg twice per day.
2.  Glipizide 10 mg twice per day.
3.  Actos 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Spironolactone 50 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Diltiazem 180 mg by mouth once per day.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:
Initial physical examination revealed the patient had a temperature of 99.1, his heart rate was 108, his blood pressure was 176/79, and his respiratory rate was 18.  
He was alert and oriented times three and in no apparent distress, comfortable.  
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  
His extremities were warm.  
He had a drain in place in his left upper quadrant with dark serous fluid.  
Rectal examination had normal tone.  
No stool in the vault, normal prostate, and guaiac-negative.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:
Initial laboratories significant for a white blood cell count of
16.1.  
The rest of his laboratories were within normal limits.  
He was also pan-cultured at the time.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:
A computed tomography of the abdomen showed an increase in the left upper quadrant fluid collection with a significant amount of air and fluid; consistent with an abscess with the percutaneous catheter inferior and posterior, and no communication with between the abscess collection and the percutaneous drain.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, he was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl.  
He was made nothing by mouth and placed on intravenous hydration and pan-cultured.
He was taken the following day for a computed tomography-guided drainage of the left upper quadrant collection.  
He continued to spike fevers, and the decision was made to take him to the operating room for definitive resection and drainage of the abscess.  
He was taken to the operating room on
[**2153-2-6**] where he underwent a en bloc excision of the abdominal tumor with a transverse colectomy, partial gastrectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy. 
Intraoperatively, they found a large intra-abdominal tumor involving the above-mentioned strictures in transverse colon and splenic flexure as well as the transverse mesocolon.  
An intraoperative gastroscopy was done which showed no mucosal lesion, but the lesion was found to be clearly adherent to the stomach.  
The liver was free of disease.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Recovery Room intubated and sedated.  
The remainder of the hospital course will be outlined by system.
1.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  
He had an epidural catheter placed intraoperatively, and this was run with good pain control. 
He was also maintained on low-dose propofol for additional sedation.
However, on postoperative day two, he spiked a fever to
101.2, and his epidural catheter was removed by the Acute Pain Service.  
He was changed to intermittent boluses of Dilaudid for pain which he tolerated well.  
His propofol was discontinued, and he was maintained on Dilaudid only.  
After extubation, he had minimal pain receiving only intermittent doses of Dilaudid; however, he did have some episodes of confusion and persistent pulling out of his nasogastric tube.
He cleared somewhat and was transferred to the floor. 
However, on postoperative day 12, he had an episode of acute confusion and was given Narcan, and all of his narcotics were discontinued.  
At this time, he was felt to have a PCO2 of 80 which decreased to 66 after treatment.
He was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit at this time for further monitoring and continued to sundown, but he was easily reoriented.  
The following day, he was found out of bed on the floor trying to go to bathroom.  
He had a completely nonfocal examination.  
At the time of discharge, he had cleared and was oriented times three with all sedative medications discontinued.
2.  
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient reported a history of bronchospasm with beta blockers, and thus was maintained on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.  
After his tube feeds were being tolerated, he was changed to intermittent oral diltiazem with good heart rate control in the 70s and 80s. 
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospitalization.
3.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  Postoperatively, her remained intubated.  
Just out of the operating room had an increasing oxygen requirement because of decreased oxygen saturations and an increased positive end-expiratory pressure requirement.
A chest x-ray was consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  
He was stabilized, and his ventilator was slowly weaned on pressure support.  
However, he initially did not tolerate a pressure support wean after adequate diuresis; however, he was able to tolerate very minimal settings.
He subsequently developed a left lower lobe opacity, and a sputum culture grew out multiresistant Klebsiella, for which he was changed to meropenem.  
He was eventually able to be extubated on postoperative day nine.  
However, he continued to have a significant oxygen requirement and continued to have low-grade temperatures.  
He received aggressive pulmonary toilet with chest physical therapy and was weaned down to room air at the time of discharge.  
He did have one episode of hypoxia, as previously mentioned, when he was on the floor associated with his acute confusion with a saturation of 73% on room air.  
He was placed on a nonrebreather with improved oxygenation.  
After transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, he was able to be weaned off his oxygen.   
However, on chest x-ray he continued to have a left lower lobe opacity/consolidation consistent with a ventilator associated pneumonia.
3.  
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  
He underwent the above-mentioned procedure including a splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and transverse colectomy. 
At the time of this dictation, the final pathology results were still pending.
He was started on tube feeds on postoperative day four. 
These were advanced to goal, and he tolerated them well without difficulty throughout his hospitalization.  
His nasogastric tube was self-discontinued on
[**2-15**]
and was replaced without incident, and his tube feeds were resumed. 
He again self-discontinued his nasogastric tube, and it was changed over to a Dobbhoff tube.  
However, this was post extubation.  
After he stabilized from a respiratory standpoint, this was removed, and he was started on an oral diet.
Because of a persistently elevated white blood cell count, he underwent an abdominal computed tomography on
[**2-17**] which showed some consolidation of the left lung base and a small amount of ascites around the liver, but no evidence of an abscess or drainable collection.
Because he continued to have a persistent white count, his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**
] fluid was sent for culture, and this subsequently grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and his antibiotic regimen was changed.  
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**] amylase was 151,230.  
Based on this elevated amylase, the decision was made to leave the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in place. 
Of note, the patient had two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**] drains placed postoperatively; however, during an episode of acute confusion one was inadvertently removed and
the second one was damage.  
However, it continued to function and he will be discharged to rehabilitation with this [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**] drain in place.
4.  
GENITOURINARY ISSUES:  The patient received several fluid boluses during the early postoperative hours for a low urine output.  
This stabilized, and he was deemed ready for diuresis on postoperative day four.  
He initially had a poor response, but by postoperative day five started to make significant urine and was changed to a Lasix drip.
However, he was found to respond better to bolused doses of Lasix and was changed back.  
He was successfully diuresed down to close to his estimated preoperative weight.  
His Foley was discontinued on postoperative day sixteen.
5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  As stated above, the patient received multiple fluid boluses for low urine output during postoperative days one through two.  
However, he was subsequently changed to maintenance fluids, but these were discontinued when his tube feeds were advanced to goal. 
He tolerated goal tube feeds throughout most of his hospital course and has now been changed to an American Diabetes Association diet.
He received the typical electrolyte repletions during his hospital stay.
However, of note, he developed a significant metabolic alkalosis around postoperative days nine to ten which was thought to have precipitated his bicarbonate retention.  
He was placed Diamox for this with improvement in his serum bicarbonate from 40 to the low 30s.  
At the time of discharge, he continued to have a stable bicarbonate and electrolytes.
6.  
ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient was initially placed on an insulin drip due to a high serum glucose.  
He was changed over to NPH when his tube feeds were at a steady state with an accompanying sliding-scale; however, he needed intermittent periods with an insulin drip due to difficult glycemic control.
His oral hypoglycemics were restarted on
[**2-21**]
; however, he continued to have elevated glucose levels.  
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 
consultation is currently pending with an Addendum to follow with their recommendations.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consultation was obtained with recommendations to continue the patient on his oral hypoglycemic medications with close monitoring of his blood sugars and consideration to add a basal insulin such as Lantus should there be problems with glycemic control and continue to hold the Actos.
7.  
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  
He was transfused 2 units of blood preoperatively, and postoperatively remained stable with the exception of transfusion of 2 units for a hematocrit of 26 and 27 from presumed blood loss anemia.  
His hematocrit stabilized, and he needed no further transfusions throughout his hospitalization.
For deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, he was placed on three times per day subcutaneous heparin at a dose of 5000 units.
However, due to his obesity and immobility, he was considered at high risk and changed to Lovenox 30 twice per day on postoperative day eight.  
Of note, in concordance with his elevated white blood cell count to the 20s, his platelet count continued to rise with a peak at 988.  
He was started on aspirin on
[**2-19**], and
his platelet count is currently trending down.
8.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  As stated above, the patient presented with fevers and had fevers preoperatively as well. 
The initial abscess, as stated above, had grown two species of enterococcus of which one was vancomycin resistant.  
His intraoperative cultures grew enterococcus, and his culture from his second preoperative percutaneous drain grew gram-negative rods of two morphologies; Proteus and Enterococcus that was vancomycin sensitive.  
Based on these presumptive cultures, he was placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl postoperatively until the final intraoperative cultures came back.  
These grew alpha strep, two species of gram-negative rods, and again probable enterococcus.  
Because of his persistent fevers and elevated white blood cell count, vancomycin was started on
[**2153-2-8**]
to provide additional coverage for Enterococcus.  
He continued to have low-grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count.  
He was pan-cultured on multiple occasions.  
His sputum culture from
[**2-8**]
grew Klebsiella pneumoniae that was highly resistant and essentially only sensitive to meropenem to cover him for a ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was noted to have some drainage from the right lateral portion of his incision which was initially serosanguineous only with turning; however, it progressed to a thick purulent appearing material and on postoperative day eight the wound was opened at the bedside.  
The fascia was intact, and a moderate amount of serosanguineous and fatty fluid was drained, but no large collection of pus was encountered.  
He was maintained on wet-to-dry dressing changes; however, the swab from that incision grew Klebsiella that was gain highly resistant and enterococcus that was resistant to levofloxacin, and penicillin, and ampicillin and sensitive to vancomycin.  
His levofloxacin was discontinued when the meropenem was started.  
Additionally, the fluid from
his 
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**] drain was sent for culture.  
However, one of these grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.  
At the time the sensitivity came back, he was than changed to linezolid on
[**2153-2-19**].  
His white blood cell count subsequently decreased from the 20s, he had been 20.9, to 12, down to 10.3, and he defervesced.
Of note, because of his splenectomy he received his post splenectomy vaccines on
[**2152-2-21**];
consisting of meningococcus, pneumovax, and haemophilus influenza type B. Of note, he is to stay on antibiotics for a total of two weeks from
[**2153-2-19**]
to consist of linezolid 600 mg intravenously twice per day and meropenem 1 gram intravenously q.8h.
; again for a total of 14 days from
[**2153-2-19**].
9.  
TUBES/LINES/DRAINS:  
He currently has
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**
Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662
**] drain in his left upper quadrant that will remain in place and a left subclavian triple lumen catheter.  
The left subclavian triple lumen should remain in to facilitate the administration of his intravenous antibiotics and should be removed after 14 days after his antibiotic course is completed.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
RESPIRATORY:  
[**Known lastname 1104**] 
was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit, intubated. 
He was treated for significant RDS with 3 doses of surfactant, requiring brief periods on high frequency ventilation and muscle relaxation before transition to conventional ventilation.
He weaned gradually to low conventional ventilation settings and was extubated to continuous positive airway pressure on day of life 6.
He required reintubation on day of life 10 for increased apnea and was subsequently extubated on day of life 26.
Then he transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure which he remained on for a total of 14 days and transitioned to room air on day of life 40 on
[**2156-3-4**]. On [**2156-3-30**]
, he was transferred to
[**Hospital3 **] to evaluate GI status. 
The infant remained in room air and was transferred back to 
[**Hospital1 18**] on day of life 83 on room air. This was on [**2156-4-16**].
On day of life 109,
[**2156-5-12**], [**Known lastname 1104**]
was intubated for his bilateral hernia repairs and was easily extubated on that day to room air.
He has completed three days without any significant apneic or bradycardic episodes or spells.
CARDIOVASCULAR:
[**Known lastname 1104**]
demonstrated mild hypotension early in life requiring dopamine support for approximately 2 days. 
He received 1 course of indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus, confirmed by echo.
Follow up echo on day of life 5 showed small patent ductus arteriosus and repeat echo on day of life 34,
[**2156-2-27**]
, showed no patent ductus arteriosus but arterial collateral from the end to side of aortic arch.
Mild hypertension was also noted in the first week of life.
Renal function was adequate and hypertension resolved.
He has been hemodynamically stable since that time.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:
Birth weight 883 grams. 
The infant was initially maintained on parenteral nutrition with initiation of enteral feeds delayed to abdominal distention.
Enteral feeds were introduced with breast milk 20 or special care 20 on day of life 11 and gradually advanced to full volume feeds on day of life 19, which is
[**2156-2-12**].
Within 48 hours she developed abdominal distension with pneumatosis and began treatment for presumed necrotizing enterocolitis.
He received bowel rest and antibiotics for 14 days during which time was [**Known lastname **]
was placed due to difficulty with access.
He was started on enteral feeds with Special Care 20 on day of life 35 and within 3 days developed abdominal distention requiring holding feeds.
Contrast enema was performed at
[**Hospital3 **]
which was within normal limits.
Abdominal distention improved and he restarted on Special Care 24 ml advancing gradually to 130 cc per kg per day by day of life 46, on
[**2155-3-11**].  
At that time he developed bloody stools with dilated intestinal loops.
He was made NPO and sepsis evaluation was performed which was unremarkable.
Following consultation with surgery he was kept NPO for 3 days and then started on Neocate formula on day of life 50.
He advanced to full volume Neocate feedings by day of life 59 and then subsequently to 24 calories.
On day of life 65,
[**2156-3-29**]
, he developed grossly bloody stools, pink rust in colors with streaks of visible blood with abdominal distention.
KUB showed pneumatosis in right lower quadrant with dilated intestinal loops.
Initial WBC and platelet counts were normal although repeat WBC on
[**3-30**] 
showed borderline neutropenia with white count of 6.5 with 50% neutrophils and 3 bands.
Blood cultures were sent and the infant was made NPO.
[**Last Name (un) 37079**]
was placed to suction and Zosyn was started.
Surgery was consulted and the infant was transferred to
[**Hospital3 **] for further surgical and GI evaluation and consideration of Omegaven therapy.
Electrolytes on
[**2156-3-29**]
, were sodium 132, potassium
2.6, chloride 93, and bicarbonate of 29.
Repeat electrolytes on
[**2156-3-30**]
, showed sodium of 138, potassium 3.2, chloride 99, and bicarbonate of 31.
At [**Hospital3 **],
the infant was NPO x7 days which was from
[**2156-3-30**], to [**2156-4-5**]. 
Upper GI and small bowel follow through were normal.
Neocate feeds began with a gradual advancement.
The infant was transferred back to
[**Hospital1 18**] advancing on enteral feeds of Neocate that was on day of life 83 which was on
[**4-16**]. 
[**Known lastname 1104**]
reached full volume enteral feeds on day of life 88 and reached full caloric feeds of Neocate 24 on day of life 95.
GASTROINTESTINAL:
The infant was initially treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity which resolved subsequently.
The infant was noted to develop significant direct hyperbilirubinemia, with bilirubin of
8.8/3.9 on day of life 48, increasing to 13.9/8.4 on day of life 61, on
[**2156-3-25**].
LFTs were mildly elevated at that time with AST of 93, and ALT of 43.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on
[**3-26**] which showed several small stones in the gallbladder but with normal liver parenchyma and no biliary duct dilatation.
GI was consulted.
Liver dysfunction was presumed secondary to PN cholestasis.
Actigall was begun on
[**2156-3-26**]. This was subsequently held on [**2156-3-29**],
due to NPO status.
Repeat labs on
[**3-29**]
, showed bilirubin 11.8/7.9, AST of 70, ALT of 38, AP 666, and albumin of 3.1.
Coagulations: PT of 14 and PTT of 40.3.
At [**Hospital3 **]
the infant was involved in Omegaven trial.
Primary investigator was Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Budahl at
[**Hospital1 **]. 
Actigall restarted on
[**4-23**]
, once enteral feeds switched at 
[**Hospital1 18**]. LFTs on [**4-27**] which was day of life 94, AST was 72, and alkaline phosphatase of 801, GGT of 111 with a bilirubin of 11.6/ 0.4.
On
[**5-4**]
, nutritional labs were done which was day of life 101.
Calcium was 9.5 with a phosphorous of 5.9, and alkaline phosphatase of 664.
On day of life 107,
[**2156-5-10**], repeat bilirubin was 8.2/4.9.  [**Known lastname 1104**]
went for bilateral inguinal hernia repair on
[**5-12**].
That surgery proceeded without complications and both hernia sites are healing nicely.
HEMATOLOGY:
The infant's blood type is A positive.
He has received approximately 7 packed red blood cells transfusion, the last one was on
[**3-29**]
for a hematocrit of 27.7, repeat hematocrit on
[**3-30**] was 41.7.  His hematocrit at [**Hospital1 **] on
[**4-12**]
, was 26.1, and his last hematocrit here on day of life 11, which is
[**5-14**], was 30 with reticulocyte count of
3.6.
He experienced mild thrombocytopenia in the first week of life not requiring platelet transfusion.
Platelet counts have been normal including during episodes of illness.  
His PT and PTT were
[**3-29**]
were 14.0 and 40.3 and repeat PT and PTT on
[**4-27**], which is day of life 94,
was 15.2, and 46.2.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
Initial CBC was negative, blood cultures were negative, but the infant received 7-days of ampicillin and cefotaxime after birth due to significant clinical illness.
He received 14 days of Zosyn from
[**2-14**], to [**2-27**]
for presumed necrotizing enterocolitis and then 3 days of Zosyn from
[**3-10**] to [**3-13**], for evaluation of colitis. 
He also received another 7 days of Zosyn, started on
[**3-29**], which ended on [**2156-4-4**]
, for presumed recurrent necrotizing enterocolitis.
The infant was maintained on prophylactic ampicillin or amoxicillin, and other antibiotics for hydronephrosis until ultrasound on
[**3-26**]
showed this to be resolved.
Multiple blood cultures throughout hospital course were negative, most recent was done on
[**3-29**]
, with no growth and has been negative.
Of note urine sample was sent for culture on
[**3-26**], as part of evaluation for direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Urinalysis was negative but urine culture subsequently grew Enterobacter and Cloacae which was sensitive to piperacillin and gentamycin.
A urine culture sent at
[**Hospital3 **] on [**4-6**]
was positive for yeast.
The infant received 7-day course of fluconazole.
Urine culture sent on
[**4-17**]
grew Enterobacter greater than 100,000 and E. coli between 10,000 to 100,000. 
The infant received 14 day course of gentamycin and cefotaxime.
Repeat urine cultures done on
[**4-20**]
were negative.
GENITOURINARY:
Renal ultrasound was performed on
[**1-27**] 
due to mild hypertension and moderate bilateral hydronephrosis noted.
No vascular thrombus was seen.
Repeat ultrasound on
[**2-12**]
showed mild right hydronephrosis and repeat ultrasound on
[**3-26**]
showed no hydronephrosis with some echogenic debris seen at the tips of the renal medullary pyramids bilaterally as well as in the bladder on his last ultrasound.
Followup renal ultrasound can be considered, renal functions have been appropriate throughout with several normal urinalyses, the last was on
[**3-26**] and last BUN and creatinine was
[**3-10**]
of 6/0.3.
Repeat renal ultrasound on 
[**4-27**]
, showed no hydronephrosis but was consistent with nephrocalcinosis.
ECG on
[**4-27**]
was normal.
Urologist consulted on
[**4-28**]
recommended no prophylactic antibiotics for prior urinary tract infections.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:
The infant received thorough eye examinations without evidence of adenopathy of prematurity.
Last eye examination on

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she underwent catheterization to rule out coronary disease after her INR was near normal.  
Heparin was then started and on
[**8-21**]
she went to the Operating Room where bilateral thoracoscopic minimazes were done, along with left atrial ligation.  
She was in sinus rhythm.  
She tolerated the operation well and chest drains were removed in the usual manner when ready.  
Flecanide was resumed per Electrophysiology request.
On
[**8-25**]
she had atrial firillation again and concverted to sinus after several 3 second pauses.  
Flecanide was discontinued.
She had episodic assymptomatic nodal rhythm to the 50s afterward and was observed.  
There was some episodic nausea which seemed to be related to the Indocin and medication times were adjusted to meals with improvement.  
Coumadin was resumed and will be managed by her primary care physician (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5057**] as preoperatively.
Her INR was 2.4 on 19/5 and she was instructed to take 5 mg of Coumadin per her preoperative routine.
She was cleared by the EP service to go home.

NICU COURSE:
Baby
[**Known lastname 47762**]
was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at approximately 2 hours of life for an initial temperature of 102.6, that was repeated 10 minutes later and 101.2 rectally.  
The baby also had occasional nasal flaring with mild tachypnea.
Baby was
[**Name2 (NI) **] at 41-
2/7 week's gestation, weighing 3.265 kg to a 29-year-old, O+, primigravida whose remaining prenatal screens were noncontributory.  
Mother's prenatal course was significant for intermittent hypertension since
[**33**] week's gestation.  
Mother was admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] for induction due to postdates.  
She delivered vaginally on
[**5-3**]
@ 2:45 am.  
The Apgar scores were 6 and 8.  
The NICU team was initially called at 1 hour of age because of grunting which resolved, and infant was transferred to the Newborn Nursery for further care.  
In the Newborn Nursery, the infant was noted to have axillary temp of 102.6 and repeat rectal of
101.2.  
He was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.
On admission, he weighed 3.265 kg, head circumference 35 cm, length 21", appropriate for gestational age.  
On admission, the infant had some decreased activity with an initial blood pressure mean of 44, heart rate 160, sats in the 94% range, and the dextrostix of initially 13, then 17, and a repeat after bolus of 48.
PROBLEMS DURING HOSPITAL STAY -
1) RESPIRATORY:  Infant initially required a brief period in nasal cannula oxygen, approximately for the first 12 hours postadmission.  
He then went to room air with no issues.  
An x-ray obtained at the time appeared to have low lung volumes which was consistent with hyaline membrane disease, even though this infant was term.  
Infant remained in room air since that time with no issues.
2) CARDIOVASCULAR:  Infant had no murmur; however, because of hypotension received two normal saline boluses and remained stable thereafter.
3) HYPOGLYCEMIA:  Initial dextrostix, as indicated above, was 13, then 17, then repeat 45.  
Infant remained on D10W from 
[**5-3**] through early morning [**5-4**], and
then remained euglycemic.
4) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient had an initial CBC with a WBC count of 16.4, hematocrit 55.1, 52 polys, 1 band, 35 lymphs, and platelet 147,000.  
Blood culture obtained and has remained negative up to the current time.  
In addition, culture was sent for herpes, although there were no risk factors for sepsis, and the clinical picture did not go along with that.  
He was never started on any antiviral medications.  
Because of his initial clinical presentation, it was elected to keep him on antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin, for a full seven days in spite of negative cultures and negative maternal history because of the hypoglycemia and hypotension.
5) FEEDING AND NUTRITION:  The infant is currently taking ad lib demand of formula or mother's milk.
6) ELEVATED TEMP:  Came down to 99 within 2 hours of admission  and has remained normal since that time.
Infant is to be transferred to the Newborn Nursery to complete his seven-day course of ampicillin and gentamicin. 
Upon discharge, he will be followed up at

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on
[**2173-10-6**]
and, later that day, was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for right total knee arthroplasty.  
Please see operative report for details.
The patient was initially treated with a PCA followed by PO pain medications on POD#1.  
The patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, as well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  
On
[**2173-10-7**]
, the patient experienced asymptomatic hypotension (88/60).
Labs obtained at tha time revealed a HCT of 18.7 following 1 unit of blood earlier in day as well as worsening acute renal failure.  
He was subsequently given another 2 units of PRBCs and transfered to SICU.  
His vital signs improved with blood resuscitation and there was no indication for need for repeat operative intervention.  
His lovenox was stopped and no CPM was carried out.  
he was placed on boots and TEDS for DVT prophylaxis.  
The Hepatology team followed him in house and monitored his immunosuppressive levels.  
He was transferred out of the SICU following transfusion of another unit of PRBCs on
[**2173-10-9**].  
The patient was placed in a CPM machine on
[**2173-10-10**] with range of motion that started at 0-
45 degrees of flexion before being increased to 90 degrees as tolerated.  
His lovenox was re-started on
[**2173-10-10**].  
The drain was removed without incident on POD#1.
The surgical dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent drainage. . 
While in the hospital, his post-operative course was complicated by abnormal liver function tests.  
Hepatology was consulted, and recommended an ultrasound with dopplers and a CT scan to rule out biliary obstruction- both were negative.  
The patient then went to ERCP given the pattern of his LFTs for a definitive diagnosis.  
ERCP showed stenosis at previous sphincterotomy site and so extenstion of sphincterotomy was done.  
The procedure was complicated by bleeding, likely secondary to thrombocytopenia. 
Post procedure AP improved.  
Patient also developed RLE cellulities; US w/ dopplers were negative for DVT.
The patient was empiricallly treated with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam and transitioned to
[**Hospital1 **] bactrim.  
During hospital course patient was maintained on his immunosuppresive therapy.  
On discharge his home tacrolimus dose was increased from 1mg twice daily to 1.5mg twice daily

Brief Hospital Course:
37yo F s/p LULT
[**5-20**]
for ETOH cirrhosis presents with fever, shortness of breath w/ bilateral lower lobe consolidations on CXR.  
Pt was admitted to the floor in a stable condition and fever work up was obtained.  
Pt was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and the pt continued to spike temperatures.  
An ID consult was obtained.  
A CT chest was performed on
[**7-9**]
which showed right upper lobe consolidation, bilat lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusions. 
The pt's respiratory status declined over the course of the first week and the pt was transferred to SICU
[**7-16**]
for hypoxia/sats in the high 80%.  
A repeat chest CT was obtained which showed worsening multi focal consolidation, thickened septum, pulm edema.  
A thoracic consult was obtained and the pt was taken to the OR on
[**7-28**] and a left mini thoracotomy/biopsy was performed.  
The pt was re-intubated post operatively for desaturations.  
Cultures/AFB were sent.  
AFB was negative x 3. 
OR cultures grew out Malazzessia furfur and the pt was started on ambisome.  
The pt was difficult to wean off the ventilator and a open tracheostomy was performed on
[**7-28**].
The pt's renal failure slowly deteriorated and the pt was switched to rapamune from tacrolimus.  
Nephrology consult was obtained.  
Although, ambisome was thought to have contributed to the pt's worsening renal failure, it was thought to be the only choice for coverage for the fungal pneumonia.  
The pt's respiratory status continued to decline and 2 species of highly resistant pseudomonas grew from sputum/BAL cultures.  
She was started on zosyn and tobramycin by dose to double cover the pseudomonas per ID. 
Over the second half of the
[**Hospital **]
hospital course, the pt developed worsening liver and renal failure and had progressive thrombocytopenia.  
She began oozing blood from her trach and mucous fistula site.  
Her coags, hct and plt were corrected with multiple transfusions.  
The pt intermittently desaturated and large mucous clots were suctioned.  
On
[**8-9**]
, the bleeding became more frequent and factor seven was given to correct her coagulopathy and a platelet ggt was ititated to keep her plt >
50. 
The last week of her hospital course, she developed increasing pressor requirement and CVVH was initiated oin
[**8-6**]
for BUN in the 100's and creatine in the 3 range.
A swan ganz catheter was placed which showed high PA pressures and a picture of worsening sepsis.  
On
[**8-8**]
, an Echo was obtained which revealed an EF 70%, 1+ MR/TR, mod pulm htn.
Over night on [**8-14**]
, she became increasingly acidotic and hypercarbic despite maximal ventilatory support.  
The pt was on multiple pressors with minimal improvement in systemic perfusion.  
The attending, family and house staff discussed futility and the pt was made comfort measures only.  
The pt expired at 3:35 am on the morning of
[**8-14**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-11-15**]
Intraop TEE Report: 
The patient developed cardiogenic shock from myocardial ischemia several minutes after the inductuion of general anesthesia.
Due to this, no pre-bypass echocardiographic imaging could be performed.
This study is composed of post bypass imaging obtained with the patient receiving epinephrine and norepinephrine by infusion and in sinus rhythm.
POST BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate mid to distal septal and anteroseptal as well as apical hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-
45 %).
The right ventricular cavity appears somewhat dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91748**]
was admitted to the cardiac surgical service.
Given his critical left main lesion, he remained in the CVICU and was started on intravenous Heparin.
He remained pain free and stable intravenous therapy.
Preoperative evaluation was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery.
The following day, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] 
performed two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. 
Operative course was notable for cardiogenic shock from myocardial ischemia several minutes after the inductuion of general anesthesia.
This required resuscitative efforts and emergent surgical intervention.
For further operative details, please see operative note.
Following surgery, he was admitted back to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. 
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
On postoperative day two, he transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery.
Beta blockade was resumed and advanced as tolerated.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm.
Over several days, he continued to make clinical improvement with diuresis and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day four.
Prior to discharge, all appropriate followup appointements were arranged.

[**2110-1-29**]
Date of Birth:
[**2110-1-7**]
Sex: M
Service: NB
HISTORY:
[**Known lastname 58670**]
is a 35
[**5-13**]
week male infant admitted with prenatal polyhydramnios, possible congenital heart disease, and issues of prematurity.
The infant was born to a 33 year old gravida I, para 0 to I mother with prenatal laboratories significant for:  Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, blood type O positive, Chlamydia negative, GC negative, unknown GBS status.
Prenatal course significant for:
1.
Concern for cardiac disease.  
On 17 week ultrasound on    
[**2109-8-29**]
she was noted to have the cardiac right ventricle    slightly larger in size compared with the left ventricle    and the heart more in midline than normal.  
There was also    concern of an echogenic bright spot in the left ventricle.    
Subsequent echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1810**]    
had concerns for coarctation due to narrowing and the left    superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus.    
There was normal function at that time with no effusion.
2.
Status post betamethasone times two doses at 30 weeks    gestation.
3.
Unexplained polyhydramnios noted on ultrasound on    
[**2110-1-1**] with AFI of 37.  
The prior ultrasound done at 19    weeks had normal AFI.
4.
There had been some concerns of hydrops without ascites    noted.  
There was some liver congestion observed on the    recent ultrasound with a thickened gallbladder.  
There was    anasarca or thickened skin noted.  
No pleural effusions    with a small pericardial effusion noted on the examination    on the day of delivery.
5.
Adequate growth initially at 46 percent with most recent    ultrasound more consistent with 60 percent.
6.
Normal 46 XY amniocentesis.
7.
Septum cavum pellucidum slightly more prominent on
[**2110-1-1**]    
ultrasound.  
Otherwise normal cerebral features.
8.
Ultrasound on
[**2110-1-7**]
revealed more anasarca as well as    pericardial effusion prompting delivery.
The infant was delivered by cesarean section with spinal anesthesia on
[**2110-1-7**].  
Vacuum assistance was required.  
The infant was 35 6/7 weeks at the time of delivery.  
Apgars were 3 at one minute, 6 at five minutes, and 7 at 10 minutes.  
He was noted to require significant pressure support in the delivery room in order to obtain chest wall movement.  
He was also noted to have decreased activity and poor respiratory effort in the delivery room.
He was intubated and brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further care.  
There was no maternal fever.  
Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery. 
Mother had received no medications.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Heart rate 140, respiratory rate 50, oxygen saturation 97 percent on 50 percent FIO2 with saturations of 25/6 at a rate of 30.  
Head circumference is 37 cm which is much greater than 90th percentile.  
Length of
45.5 cm which is between the 25th and 50th percentile and weight of 2600 grams which is the 50th percentile.  
Four extremity blood pressures revealed right arm systolic blood pressure of 78, right leg systolic blood pressure of 65, left arm systolic blood pressure of 75 and left leg systolic blood pressure of 60.  
In general he appears macrocephalic relative to the rest of the body.  
Anterior fontanelle is open and full.  
He has decreased activity with only slight response during examination and minimal spontaneous activity.  
Eyes closed. 
Nondysmorphic facial features.  
Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 with no murmur appreciated.  
Pericardium with normal activity.  
Examination of the lungs revealed coarse breath sounds.  
Chest wall not binding.  
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended.  
Liver was difficult to assess due to thickened skin but it is palpable slightly below right costal margin and not enlarged. 
Decreased perfusion of lower extremities compared with upper extremities and femoral pulses difficult to palpate.  
Skin was slightly thickened.  
Petechiae noted over the chest, abdomen, face and arms.  
Phallus appears to be normal male. 
Testes descended bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.
RESPIRATORY:  Patient was intubated in the delivery room    and has remained intubated throughout his hospital course.    
Initial chest x-ray had no concerns of lung disease.  
On    day of life number 7 he developed respiratory    acidosis with an echocardiogram showing significant    pulmonary hypertension.  
Settings were adjusted    with subsequent improvement in the acidosis.  
Follow up    echocardiogram demonstrated no PPHN and his current    settings are 24/6 with a rate of 38, FIO2 between 29 and    35 percent.  
His most recent gas was pH of 7.29 with a    pCO2 of 61, pO2 132.  
This was an arterial gas.  
The patient    intermittently breathed over the vent.
2.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Due to concern over biventricular    function, the differential systolic blood pressures as    well as differential perfusion in the upper versus lower    extremities with a prenatal echocardiogram demonstrating    possible coarctation, prostaglandins were started shortly    after birth.  
An echocardiogram subsequently showed    decreased biventricular function with a large PDA and no    coarctation visualized.  
Therefore, the prostaglandins    were stopped and pre and postductal as well as four    extremity blood pressures were closely monitored.  
Pre and    postductal saturations as well as four extremity blood    pressures have remained normal.  
Serial echos have not    demonstrated evidence of coarctation of the aorta.
Due to hypotension dopamine was started on day of    life number one.  
Dobutamine was added on day of life    number three due to persistent hypotension and follow    up echocardiogram showing continued but decreased    biventricular function.  
The goal mean arterial pressures    were 37 to 40.  
Due to continued issues with hypotension and    pressor requirement, digoxin was added on day of life 11    (without digitalization).
Dobutamine was able to be weaned off    on day of life 14 and dopamine was weaned off on day of    life 16.  
The patient remains on Digoxin twice daily with    normal blood pressures.  
His most recent echocardiogram    was on day of life 21 showed moderately depressed right    ventricular function, borderline left ventricular function and    small (1.8 mm) PDA with continuous left to right flow.
The patient had an UAC and a UVC placed shortly after birth.    
On day of life seven a left saphenous PICC line was placed and    the UVC was removed.  
The UAC was also removed on day of life    number 7.  
On day of life number 8 a peripheral arterial line    was placed which was subsequently removed on day of life    number 20.
3. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been    NPO for the majority of the hospital course.  
Total fluids    initially were started at 80 cc per kilo per day and    increased to 150 cc per kilo per day over the course of    the first week.  
Fluids are currently at 140 cc per kilo    per day due to concerns of excessive weight gain and fluid    retention.  
The patient has received intermittent doses of    Lasix with good diuresis.  
Lytes have
[**Last Name (un) 26886**]
been within normal    limits.  
Birth weight was 2600 grams.    
Current weight is 3045 grams.  
[**Doctor First Name 4051**]
was started on    enteral feeds on day of life 19 with Special Care 20.  
At    maximum he was receiving 20 cc per kilo enterally and
the    remainder was PN/IL with goal calories of 90 per kg per day.    
He is currently NPO on 140 ml/kg/day PN/IL in preparation for    the operating room.
4.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  
[**Known lastname 58670**]
did develop an indirect    hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin on day of life    number four of 14.1.  
Phototherapy was initiated on day of    life number four and stopped on day of life number seven.    
Rebound bilirubin have remained normal.  
He did begin    developing a direct hyperbilirubinemia, maximum direct    bilirubin was 2.8 on day of life number 18.  
This has    been stable.
5.
HEME:  The patient was transfused on day of life number    two, day of life number eight, and on day number 21 with    packed red blood cells.  
His most recent hematocrit was    51.5 on day of life 22.  
His platelet count has been to a    low of 74 on day of life number four.  
Is most recent    platelet count on day of life 22 was 146.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  
[**Known lastname 58670**]
was initially started on    ampicillin and gentamicin for a 48 hour rule out sepsis    course.  
His cultures remained negative at 48 hours therefore    the antibiotics were discontinued.  
Vancomycin and gentamicin    were begun on day of life number 11 for concerns of    temperature instability.  
When blood cultures were    negative at 48 hours these were discontinued.  
Vancomycin    and gentamicin were again begun on day of life number 13,    again for temperature instability.  
These antibiotics were    again discontinued after 48 hours of negative blood    cultures.  
The patient is currently on no antibiotics.
Infectious disease service was consulted secondary to the    hypotonia, cardiac dysfunction as well as petechiae.    
Blood cultures were sent which was negative on three    separate occasions.  
Cerebrospinal fluid was also sent    and was negative.  
Viral cultures were sent and were    negative.  
CMV, parvovirus, toxoplasma and enterovirus all    returned negative.  
The patient does have cerebrospinal fluid    on hold at the
[**Hospital1 **]
laboratory control if there is a need for    further infectious disease or metabolic testing.
7.
NEUROLOGY:  
Neurology was consulted on day of life number    one due to marked weakness/hypotonia.  
On day of life    number one a head ultrasound was performed which showed    mild ventriculomegaly, but no significant hydrocephalus.  
On    day of life number one an MRI was also performed which showed    a structurally normal brain with increased extraaxial fluid.    
On day of life number six an EEG was performed which was also    normal.  
On day of life 7 a lumbar puncture was performed    which was also normal.  
Lactate and pyruvate were normal.    
Ammonia was initially slightly elevated but normal on repeat    (105).
The patient had a CPK initially which was elevated at    570.
Repeat was 409.  
This elevated value prompted an EMG on    day of life 15 which was read as concern for motor neuropathy.    
The plan is for a muscle, nerve and skin biopsy on
[**2110-1-29**]    
at
[**Hospital3 1810**].
[**Known lastname 58670**]
is currently on Fentanyl at 1 mcg per kilo per hour for    pain control (demonstrated by tachycardia and grimacing with    interventions).
This has been weaned over the past few days    from a maximum of 2 mcg per kilo per hour.
8. GENETICS/METABOLISM:  Genetics was consulted initially and    chromosomes were sent which revealed normal 46XY.  
FISH for    Prader Willi was sent which revealed disomy in chromosome 15    although methylation studies are still pending.  
Very long    chain fatty acids (for Zellweger's) as well as carbohydrate    deficient transferrin have both returned as normal.  
Urine    organic acids showed nonspecific elevations.  
Serum amino    acids as well as spinal muscular atrophy gene test and    myotonic dystrophy gene test are still pending.

IMAGING
CXR:
1.  Endotracheal tube with its tip less than 1 cm from the level of the carina, suggest repositioning.
2.  Low lung volumes, and cardiomegaly, with bibasilar atelectasis. . 
EGD
Findings:
Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 5 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
The varices were not bleeding. 
4 bands were successfully placed.
Stomach:
Mucosa: Diffuse continuous granularity, erythema and mosaic appearance of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with Portal hypertensive gastropathy. 
Despite pre-EGD erythromycin and multiple attempts at suctioning the clot, fundus could not be completely visualized.
But no gastroesophageal varices noted near GE junction.
Duodenum:
Not examined. . 
KUB There has been placement of a large caliber tube in the stomach with a balloon in the region of the body of the stomach.  
The distal tip is in the stomach antrum.  
There are several non-dilated loops of air-filled small bowel.  
There is air seen in the colon.  
No free intra-abdominal gas is present. . 
CT abdomen and pelvis
1.  Liver demonstrates lobulated contour, compatible with patient's known history of underlying cirrhosis.  
Portal vein is thrombosed. 
The thrombus extends into the right and left portal veins.
There is possible enhancement of the thrombus, suggestive of tumor thrombus.
The distal left portal vein is opacified.  
The liver is of heterogeneous enhancement.  
Multiple hepatic hypodensities are present.  
Ill-defined areas of hypodensities in the liver may represent infarction or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
2.  Large amount of ascites.
3.  
Bowel wall edema of the cecum and ascending colon may reflect third spacing, infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic causes.
4.  Small bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis, infection or aspiration. .
CXR:
The tip of the endotracheal tube has been pulled back and the tip is now 3 cm above the carina.  
There is again seen a left-sided PICC line with its lead tip in the proximal SVC perpendicular to SVC wall.  
There are no pneumothoraces.  
The heart size is within normal limits.  
There is some atelectasis and low lung volumes at the lung bases.  
There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. .
Brief Hospital Course:
71yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented with acute variceal bleed initially requiring intubation and
[**Last Name (un) **] 
placement that has since resolved. . 
# Variceal bleed:  Presented with hematemesis and initial EGD was without a clear lesion for intervention but suspected to be a variceal bleed.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
tube was placed and subsequently removed once patient stabilized.
Repeat EGD showed 5 cords of grade III varices in the lower third of the esophagus and 4 bands were successfully placed.
Patient was transfused a total of 2 units of PRBCs and since then blood counts remained stable and he has had no further melena.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a portal vein thrombus, and therefore was determined not to be a TIPS candidate.
Patient was started on pantoprazole and octreotide drips.
Pantoprazole was changed to IV BID and octreotide was continued for 72 hours.
He also completed a course of ceftriaxone for 5 days.
Nadolol, oral proton-pump inhibitor, and sucralafate were started for prophylaxis and treatment of his recent bleed.
# Abdominal distension: Patient markedly distended on exam.
He was insufflated with quite a bit of air during his endoscopy with rising bladder pressures, relieved by placement of rectal tube and decompression of abdominal gas.
Bladder pressures trended down, urine output improved, and abdominal exam clinically improved.
Patient spiked a fever during his stay and diagnostic paracentesis initially grew coag-negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) **]
albicans.
Repeat CT was performed which showed no signs of perforation so patient was empirically started on fluconazole for a total of seven days and zosyn for 48 hours.
Therapeutic paracentesis the following day revealed only small pockets of fluid.
700cc of fluid was drained and this fluid was negative for any organisms suggesting earlier sample was contaminated. 
Patient remained afebrile and without leukocytosis for the remainder of his stay.
His belly remained distended but this was felt to be potentially more related to tumor burden (see below) rather than ascites so he was not started on diuretics.
Despite low suspicion for infection, he will continue fluconazole for a seven day course.
He was started on oxycodone for his discomfort.
# Hep C cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophageal varices. 
Hep C viral load was 1.6 million and Hepatitis B serologies were negative.
Once variceal bleed stabilized, patient was started on nadolol for prophylaxis.
Given no history of encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ciprofloxacin, lactulose and rifaxamin were not initiated at this time.
# Possible hepatocellular carcinoma -
Patient had CT scan which revealed multiple irregular hepatic hypodensities and portal vein thrombosis, likely from associated tumor.
AFP was elevated to 126.1.
Patient will require further imaging with MRI/MRCP and discussion of possible treatment of his likely hepatocellular carcinoma
# s/p intubation: Patient intubated at outside hospital for airway protection in the setting of GI bleed.
When HCTs stabilized, sedation was stopped and the patient was successfully extubated.
# Hypertension: He was transitioned to nadolol and his blood pressures remained well-controlled.
His amlodipine was held at discharge as he was normotensive.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -
Further workup and management of his hepatocellular carcinoma will need to occur in

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr.
[**Known lastname 111935**]
, You were admitted to the hospital after vomiting blood and losing consciousness.
You had a breathing tube placed to protect your lungs as we controlled the bleeding.
We found that the bleeding was coming from the esophagus and the stomach and we controlled the bleeding with banding of the blood vessels.
We also performed a CT scan that showed some fluid in your abdomen and areas of the liver concerning for liver cancer.
We removed a small amount of this fluid from your abdomen to make you more comfortable.
Once you are home, you will need a repeat endoscopy in three weeks to make sure the bleed is healing and an MRI of the liver to rule out cancer.
Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your gastroenterologist in
[**Location (un) **]
once you arrive home.
You will need to discuss further treatment for your possible liver cancer as well as repeat endoscopy to evaluate the the blood vessels in your GI tract.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo F with h/o DMII, HTN, hypercholerolemia presents with ARF, UTI and hypotension.
1.
Hypotension -
resolved with IVF's.
Etiology likely secondary to bacteremia and volume depletion in setting of decreased po intake and polyuria. 
-
Her BP meds (pravachol 20mg po q24h, HCTZ 25 mg qod, and lisinopril 5mg po q24h) were initially held however were restarted prior to discharge w/o difficulty.
2.
Pansensitive GNR bacteremia likely from urinary infection.
BP remained stable, pt remained afebrile.
She was initially on Cipro and Ceftaz, this was changed to levofloxacin on
[**2195-5-9**] for a 10 day course.  
All surveillance BCx's were w/o growth.
3. UTI -
likely etiology for initial symptoms.
Treated with levofloxacin as above.
4.
ARF -
now resolved (Cr 1.8->1.0), likely prerenal given improvement w/ hydration (FeNa 0.2%).
5.
Lactic Acidosis thought to be secondary metformin use, hypotension, infection, and ARF now resolved.
Gap closed. 
-
Her metformin was restarted at discharge.
6.
Elevated troponin likely secondary to decreased renal clearance of troponins w/ ARF, trended down w/ improvement in renal function. 
-
She was continued on ASA, ACEI, and statin
7. DM2.
Pt has been told to increase Lantus in the past by
her [**Name8 (MD) 3782**]
MD's however is concerned about hypoglycemia and would rather increase humalog sliding scale.
Ketones in urine likely secondary to starvation ketosis and not DKA (bld sugars under 300).

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted directly to the operating room where he had an Aortic valve replacement andc coronary bypass grafting. 
Please see operative report for details.
In summary he had an AVR(#27
[**Company 1543**]
Mosaic tissue valve and CABG x2 with LIMA-LAD and RIMA-RCA.
His bypass time was 134 minutes with a crossclamp of 94 minutes.  
A right femoral arterial line was placed in the Operating Room through a prior graft.  
He tolerated the operation well, and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. 
Vascular surgery was consulted (they were familiar with him from his prior procedure) and the femoral line was maintained with a heparin infusion overnight.
Postoperatively CXR showed right upper lobe collapse and he subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy.  
Repeat CXR after bronchoscopy revealed good aeration of the right upper lobe.  
On POD 1 the Doppler signal to the left lower extremity was abscent.  
Vascular surgery opted to take him to the Operating Room to evaluate the flow, and a thrombectomy of left lower extremity common femoral artery to peroneal artery bypass vein graft, balloon angioplasty of the left femoral artery to peroneal artery bypass graft, and balloon angioplasty of the distal anastamosis at distal AT/DP.
See operative note for full details.  
Right arterial line was pulled in the Operating Room by the vascular team without incidence. 
He was continued on heparin gtt and started on Coumadin.  
On post operative #2 he developed respiratory distress and acidosis, a surgical consult was requested out of concern that he might be developing an acute abdominal process.
He had increasing abdominal distention, his hematocrit had trended down and he was reintubated, swan ganz catheter was placed. 
Abdominal cat scan was negative for any acute process.  
He developed non-oliguric acute tubular nephrosis at this time and creatinine peaked at 2.7.  
His diuretics were discontinued and his creatinine was back down to baseline (1.1) at the time of discharge.  
He remained hemodynamically stable after resuscitation and was extubated the following day.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  
He was transferred to the floor on post operative day 4.  
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation at that time and started on an amiodarone bolus and drip and Lopressor was increased.
He converted to sinus rhythm and remained in sinus for 24 hours prior to discharge.
He was started on warfarin to which he was extremely sensitive.
His INR rose from 1.5 to 9.9 after  two doses 4mg on day1 and 1mg on day2.
He received FFP to correct this and warfarin was held for 2 days.
He was slightly confused and all narcotics were discontinued and he cleared.
He was pain free at the time of discharge.  
He was continued on Coumadin for anticoagulation for vascular issues and his PCP

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Respiratory:
On admission, [**Known firstname 1661**]
was noted to have occasional desaturations, prompting the use of nasal cannula oxygen.  
Periodic breathing with frequent apneic and bradycardiac episodes were seen on monitoring.
Due to a persistent immature breathing pattern, the decision was made to perform a pneumogram.  
The initial pneumogram results were consistent with an immature breathing pattern with 1) no prolonged central apnea, 2) no obstructive apnea, 3) normal baseline saturations of 96-
100%, 4) however with frequent drops to the mid 85 -
90% associated with short central apnea and periodic breathing (4.6% of sleeping time). 
The pH probe portion of the study did not reveal any gastroesophageal reflux.
There was no bradycardia.
Infant was started on caffeine citrate after the first pneumogram.
He was loaded with a 20 mg/kg dose followed 24 hrs later with 8 mg/kg daily maintenance dosing.
He weaned into room air on
[**2159-5-15**].  
A repeat pneumogram after five doses of the maintenance caffeine was performed.  
Results were improved with 1) continued no prolonged central apnea, obstructive apnea, or bradycardia; and 2) baseline saturations of 97-
99% in room air with less frequent drops to 85% in conjunction with short central apnea.
The infant was discharged on caffeine citrate and home monitoring.

Admitted same day surgery and brought directly to the operating room where he underwent a aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative report for surgical details.
He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.  
Postoperatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic management.  
In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complications. 
He was noted for apnea and was placed on autoCPAP and sleep was consulted ith plan for him to follow up in sleep clinic.  
[**Last Name (un) **] 
was consulted due to elevated hgba1c on insulin pump, insulin was adjusted and he was started on lantus.  
He remained in the intensive care unit an extra day to manage his blood glucose. 
Post operative day two he was transferred to the floor for the remainder of his care.  
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  
Psychiatry was consulted in relation to his medications due to him stopping lithium preoperatively.

[**2185-7-25**]
History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old male with PMH of stage II COPD with an FEV1 consistently in the low 60s on 3-
5L of home O2, pulmonary HTN with estimated pulmonary pressures of 84 mm Hg on recent ECHO
[**6-25**], secondary polycythemia, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and HTN, recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for 4 days in mid-[**2185-6-14**]
for dyspnea deemed to be related to a COPD/diastolic CHF exacerbation, now re-presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia initially requiring biPAP initiation in the emergency room but quickly weaned down to his home oxygen requirement.  
He was last admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**]
with a similar presentation last month; however, he states that he was much more short of breath this time around.  
During his last admission he was diagnosed with multifactorial acute respiratory distress deemed mostly secondary to a COPD and acute on chronic diastolic CHF flare.  
He was treated with an extended prednisone taper and increasing his home Lasix dose.  
He was seen in follow-up by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt that he had a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral URI.  
The patient reports that his last dose of prednisone was the day prior to this admission.  
He feels as though his breathing did not benefit from the prednisone.  
He had been started on high dose prednisone at the end of
[**2185-5-15**].  
Of note, he also mentions having chills starting 2 days ago which seems to have resolved at this point. 
He does not recall any appreciable fevers or sweats.  
He does report coughing vigorously starting erlier this week which was initially productive of clear phlegm, but has now become more of a dry cough.  
He reports that this current flare of his dyspnea started at the end of [**Month (only) 547**] at which point he was started on prednisone and he has never really returned to his baseline since that time.  
He does have seasonal allergies and notes that he was exposed to a fair amount of pollen this spring around the time that his symptoms flared.  
Otherwise, he does not have sick contacts and his weights have been stable.  
He chronically sleeps on 2 pillows at night.
In the ED, initial VS were: T=99.8, HR=120, BP=117/62, RR=26, POx=84% on 4L.  
He was triggered in the ED for hypoxia.  
Per report, he was mentating well and appeared non-toxic.  
He was initially placed on a non-rebreather which raised his oxygen saturation to the 90s.  
He did well on non-rebreather, but was eventually found to be tachypneic and was placed on biPAP.  
His oxygen saturations remained in the high 90s on biPAP.  
He was then graduated to a face mask and eventually back down to his home nasal cannula at 5L.  
He was initially given nitroglycerin and aspirin to rule out if he had any component of ACS. 
Cardiology was consulted and he was seen by Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] who found him very short of breath with prompt desaturations seen with leg lifts and lying down thought to potentially be secodary to an unrecognized cardiopulmonary shunt.  
Labs were significant for a lactate of 3.1, negative troponin, creatinine of 1.3 up from 1, and a slighly elevated white count to 12.8.
Prior to transfer to the MICU vital signs were BP=126/69, HR=99, RR=20, POx=89% on 5L NC.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports that he feels better than when he was discharged after his last hospitalization.

[**2185-7-27**]
7:46 PM No pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral, diffuse, primarily apical reticular and micronodular opacities in both lungs have progressed
[**6-28**]. 
Numerous small mediastinal lymph nodes have increased in size and number since the prior study.

These findings are non-specific and etiologies include infection, inflammation, or hypersensitivity.
Moderate to severe coronary calcifications.
Brief Hospital Course:
MR [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 76 year old male with PMH of stage II COPD with an FEV1 consistently in the low 60s on 3-
5L of home O2, pulmonary HTN with estimated pulmonary pressures of 84 mm Hg on recent ECHO
[**6-25**], secondary polycythemia, obstructive sleep 
apnea on CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and HTN, recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for 4 days in mid-[**2185-6-14**]
for dyspnea deemed to be related to a COPD/diastolic CHF exacerbation, now re-presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia initially requiring biPAP initiation in the emergency room. 
. 
#.
Acute respiratory distress. 
Patient reported worsening respiratory symptoms over a few days prior to admission with productive cough and chills.
This was initially concerning for possible pneumonia, but exam and CXR findings were not suggestive of this and patient remained afebrile.
At baseline, he has moderate stage II COPD on home O2 of 3-
5L NC.
Recent evaluation of chronic hypoxia revealed chest CT with possible TBM, small airways disease, and several pulmonary nodules, and ECHO with worsening pulmonary artery hypertension with estimated pressure of 84 mm Hg from 51 mm Hg in
[**10-24**].  
PFTs remained stable and a V/Q scan which was low probability for PE.  
He has had a bubble study in
[**10-24**] which was suboptimal for evaluation of cardiopulmonary shunt.
Given concern for pulmonary hytertension, he
[**Date Range 1834**]
evaluation with right heart catheterization which revealed significant pulmonary hypertension with some response nitric oxide administration.
He was started on a trial of sildenafil at 20 mg TID and this was communicated to his pulmonary MD, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was continued on oxygen therapy at 6L nc.
A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, however, concerning for findings of pneumonitis.
The final read of CT was pending at the time of discharge, however, imaging reviewed with attending and communicated with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. . 
He was continue on his previous COPD regimen including tiotropium, advair, and albuterol inhalers. 
. 
#.
Chronic diastolic CHF.
EF > 55% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis on most recent ECHO in
[**6-25**].  
Appeared euvolemic on exam.
His furosemide was initially held in the setting of pre-renal azotemia on admission, but home dose 20mg daily was later resumed.
Right heart catheterization confirmed that elevated left heart pressures were not primary cause of pulmonary hypertension. 
. 
#.
[**Last Name (un) **].
Cr=1.3 on admission from 1 at baseline likely secondary to prerenal etiology from poor oxygenation/perfusion.
Held home furosemide initially, but this was restarted at home dose 20 mg qday prior to discharge.
Cr was 1.0 on d/c. . 
#.
Leukocytosis.  
WBC=12.8 on admission likely secondary to recent increase in steroid dosing versus stress reaction.  
No signs of acute infection by symptoms or imaging.
Leukocytosis resolved and patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his course. 
. 
#.
Polycythemia.  
Hct=50.7 on admission.  
Polycythemia is noted to be chronic dating back to
[**12/2184**] and likely secondary to chronic hypoxia in setting for COPD and pulmonary hypertension. 
. 
#.
Obstructive sleep apnea.  
Continued home CPAP at night. 
Patient was previously not very compliant with this.
Likely contributes in small way to pulmonary HTN, thus important to continue using regularly. .

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] is a 78 year old woman with a PMHx of afib (not on coumadin), DM2, and
dementia admitted for HHS with glucose to
1053.
# HHS: Glucose elevated to 1053 on admission with anion gap 25, hemoconcentrated to Hct 54.  
Glucose on u/a but no ketones. 
Although this picture could also be consistent with b-hydroxybutyrate ketoacidosis, the high glucose and type II diabetes history makes HHS more likely.
AG could also be secondary lactate elevation from poor perfusion in the setting of volume depletion.
AG resolved within 12 hours of IVF.
The underlying trigger of her HHS is uncertain.
Urinalysis demonstrates 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Streaky RLL ifiltrate on CXR was thought unlikely to be pneumonia.
Ischemic cardiac event was ruled out with troponins x
4.
Considering that she was reported as poorly complaint at her ECF with medications, and refused several medications each day while in the MICU, she likely had an aspect of medical noncompliance either contributing or even causing her HHS.
Her non-compliance and/or inadequacy of home diabetes therapy is further bolstered by her A1C of 12.
She was started on insulin drip, received 7 L of IV fluids, and then was transitioned to a SQ insulin regimen
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] recommendations which included a QACHS insulin sliding scale with humolog and QHS lantus.
We held her oral diabetes medication while inpatient.
On transfer to the floor from the MICU the patient was stable and her blood sugar was being controlled with SQ insulin regimen. . 
# UTI: Admission urinalysis concerning for possible UTI, but culture more likely contamination.  
Pt asyptomatic.  
Received 3-day course of levofloxacin.  
Urinalysis demonstrated 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Urine culture with 10-
100K gram positive cocci concerning for lactobacillus vs. group a strep.
[**12-24**]
sets of blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**]
was treated for her UTI with 3 days of levofloxacin. 
. 
# HLD: Simvastatin was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house. . 
# HTN: Atenolol was continued
while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house. 
Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3 which responded to 0.9 with IVF. . 
# afib: Ms.
[**Known lastname 1187**]
was rate controlled while in house with atenolol.
Aspirin was started. . 
Transitional issues: 1.
Diabetes.
Reportedly poor medication compliance at ECF (patient sometimes hides pills).
[**Last Name (un) **]
consulted and started on insulin per med list.
Please have sugars followed closely.
Thus her Metformin and glypizide were stopped.
2.
Her lisinopril and furosemide were stopped in the setting of her acute illness.
Please start these as you see fit if her blood pressures become elevated as her systolic blood pressure have been in the 110's prior to discharge here and thus we didn't start them.
3.
A second round of blood cultures are pending on discharge given coag pos staph in blood culture on admission.

Although the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital stay was quite complicated he was able to be discharged in stable condition with improvement in his anterior chest pain.
The patient has a plan is to followup with his primary care physician chronic pain physician as well as the plastic surgeon who performed the patient's surgeries.

[**2136-8-8**]
6:45 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.
Focal dissection at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus extending from T10 to L1.
Better characterization could be obtained if desired with a dedicated CT angiographic study.
No surrounding hematoma
2.
Complete right upper lobe collapse likely from aspirated secretions
3.
Endotracheal tube 5 cm above the carina.
4.

Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of
[**2136-8-8**] 
6:45 AM
IMPRESSION:
Fractures of the C7 lateral mass, the transverse processes of T1 bilaterally, the right posterior first rib and bilateral posterior second ribs though the second right rib fracture is better seen on the accompanying CT Torso.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:
In addition to the above, there is an apparent significant disc herniation, possibly acute, at C4-
5, which effaces the ventral thecal sac and may indent the underlying cord.
This is poorly evaluated by this modality and would be better-assessed by MR, which would also be warranted (including axial T1-weighted sequences with fat-saturated sequences), if there is suspicion of left vertebral arterial injury in association with the C7 left posterior element fracture.

GRAM STAIN (Final
[**2136-8-21**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   
POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.       
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.    
SPARSE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for trauma evaluation and subsequently admitted to the acute care surgery service on
[**2136-8-8**]. . 
Patient intubated in field, transferred to
[**Hospital1 **]
with large RLE degloving injury, CTA of RLE revealed no evidence of extravasation, poor visualization of vessels distal to ankle likely secondary to edema.  
Patient was taken to the OR for several washout and debridements and wound vac placements to the RLE by the Acute Care Service (ACS).
The Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery service was consulted for help with RLE wound closure.  
A skin graft was recommended post adequate debridement. . 
The Vascular service was consulted for intimal flap noted at level of T10 on initial scans.
This was a traumatic aortic dissection not involving any major branches off of the aorta. 
THe patient remained hemodynamically stable with the exception of hypotension with propofol.
Vascular recommended tight blood pressure control with goal systolics 100-
140 and a repeat CT in a few days.  
A repeat CT performed on
[**2136-8-11**]
showed an intimal flap again noted within the distal thoracic aorta starting near the diaphragmatic hiatus and terminating above the renal arteries, in a similar distribution as on the prior CT of
[**8-8**]. 
Vascular recommended a repeat CT in 6 months with Vascular follow up appointment. 
. 
Neurosurgery was also consulted given CT spine findings of fractures seen through the left lateral mass of C7 as well as the first transverse processes bilaterally. 
Neurosurgery recommended that C-Collar should continue at all times and that the patient should follow up with a repeat CT scan of the cervical spine in 8 weeks post the original trauma. 
C-collar was maintained in hospital and patient compliance was reinforced several times. . 
On
[**2136-8-15**]
the patient went to the OR with Plastics service and had a split thickness skin graft to RLE wound from right thigh donor site.  
He was then transferred to the care of the Plastics service.  
A wound vac was applied to graft site and removed on 
[**2136-8-21**] to reveal a skin graft site with approximately 90% take.  
The graft site did have an odor when the wound vac appliance was removed.  
There was no evidence of purulent drainage but a swab culture was obtained and sent and patient was placed on Augmentin PO. 
. 
The Heme-Onc service was consulted for patient's history of DVT/PE and to help determine whether patient needed to resume coumadin therapy.  
Patient was maintained on heparin subcutaneous injections during his initial admission. 
Recommendations included obtaining doppler studies of BLEs as well as a chest CT to rule out PE.  
Lower extremity dopplers revealed 3 blood clots to the left lower extremity and evidence of an old clot to the right lower extremity.  
The chest CT revealed evidence of an old pulmonary embolus.  
Patient's heparin subcutaneous injections wer discontinued and patient was initiated on Lovenox injections.  
Patient was commenced back on coumadin on
[**2136-8-21**] while maintaining a lovenox bridge. 
Heme-Onc recommended maintaining this bridge until INR became therapeutic between
[**1-5**].  
Hypercoagulation labs were also obtained and sent with exception of Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin Mutation Analysis which will need to be obtained as an outpatient.  
The lab values were still pending at the time of this discharge.  
Patient's PCP,

[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5139**]
, will follow up with the Plastics service regarding any outstanding data that she requires. .
Pain:
Patient's pain was controlled utilizing Dilaudid PCA, injections, and IV during periods of severe pain.  
Once patient's pain had decreased he reported good pain control with Oxycodone.
ID:
Patient had a PICC inserted to left upper extremity for IV antibiotics and blood draws.  
Patient was initially given cefazolin and unasyn IV upon admission.  
Unasyn IV was maintained and then patient was changed to PO Augmentin upon discharge to rehab facility.
The left upper extremity PICC line was discontinued.  
Directly after discharge from floor, micro swab from RLE wound cultures grew Pseudomonas.  
[**Hospital3 **] 
facility was called immediately and updated on this new information and it was agreed that Ciprofloxacin 500mg po BID x 14 days would be added to medication regimen.
GI/GU:
Patient initially had foley catheter upon admission but this was discontinued when indicated and patient was able to void without issue.  
Patient was maitained on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movements.
At the time of discharge on hospital day #15, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with , voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 49 year old male with a history of alcohol abuse transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit from an outside hospital with acute renal failure in the setting of worsening encephalopathy.  
The patient was admitted to 
[**Hospital3 15174**] approximately four days prior to admission with confusion and shaking chills.  
He received intravenous fluids and p.o.
lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.  
On admission there, his white blood cell count was elevated as were his transaminases.  
He was started on Unasyn.  
He was evaluated by GI and an abdominal ultrasound showed a small intestinal diverticula, gallstones, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
The patient's admission creatinine was 2.5, which subsequently improved with hydration to 1.5 on
[**2-21**].  
Urine culture showed greater than 100,000 colonies of Staphylococcus aureus which was pan-sensitive.  
The patient was evaluated by Infectious Disease service and his antibiotics were changed to Nafcillin and Levaquin.  
On 
[**2-20**]
, the patient had some slight improvement in his mental status; his creatinine was trending down although he had a persistently elevated white blood cell count.  
CT scan of the abdomen revealed ascites, a gallstone, but no biliary obstruction; it was notable for pyelonephritis with a left kidney mass.  
The patient was started on Prednisone for a question of alcoholic hepatitis.
On the day of transfer to the
[**Hospital1 188**]
, the patient was noted to be hypotensive to the 70s with no urinary output over a six to eight hour period.  
He was bolused with intravenous fluids with no response.  
He was started on a low dose Dopamine drip.  
A PA catheter was placed for measure of intra-cardiac pressure which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 2.  
He did response to fluid boluses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 346**] where he underwent aggressive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy complicated by sepsis, thought to be of urinary origin.  
The patient was maintained on antibiotics and multiple pressor support.  
His abdomen became increasingly distended over his hospitalization.  
The patient developed worsening renal failure which was thought to be complicated by increased abdominal distention with increased bladder pressures.
The patient ultimately developed shock liver likely complicated by alcoholic hepatitis.  
He had no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis but had significant ascites which was removed by paracentesis.  
In the setting of his sepsis, the patient's acute renal failure progressed to acute tubular necrosis.  
He was intermittently hyperkalemic and acidotic.  
The patient also with coagulopathy secondary to liver failure.
After a three day hospital course during which the patient was treated aggressively with fluids, antibiotics and pressors as above, the patient died on
[**2111-2-24**].  
His family was contact[**Name (NI)
**] regarding an autopsy and agreed to a post-mortem.  
The attending physician was also notified.

LIFEWATCH (REPORT PER NOTES;
[**2177-6-18**]): 
Life Watch monitor which revealed significant sinus pauses up to 4 seconds long.
She also had episodes of AF with RVR in the 150's.
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms.
[**Known lastname 111653**]
is a 80 F with a history of atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome documented by Lifewatch monitor who was admitted for pacemake placement; procedure was complicated by pneumothorax following subclavian access. .
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# PNEUMOTHORAX: Pt admitted for pacemaker placement that was complicated by pneumothorax, initially noted on fluoroscopy following air in syringe with attempted subclavian vein access. 
Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest xray and though ptient remained asymptomatic, serial xrays revealed that left pneumothorax has increased in volume with substantial atelectasis at the base of the lung as well as a small and increasing left pleural effusion.  
Pt was attempted on 100% oxygen to assist in resorption of the pneumothorax, however given interval increase in volume, thoracic surgery placed pigtail catheter with interval resolution of pneumothorax within 24 hours.  
Catheters were removed without incidence and patient was discharged home on room air. 
. 
# TACHY-BRADY SYNDROME S/P PACEMAKER: Pacemaker placement was complicated by pneumothorax.  
Initially pacemaker was programed to DDD setting, with beats alternating between A/V pace and V paced only.  
Pacer interogration revealed that it was functioning properly, however pt often had episodes of being paced at max rate in response to sensed atrial fibrillation beats.  
Therefore, the decision was made to change pacer settings to DDI.
On DDI she continued to atrial pace while in a-fib, however, there was no elevated ventricular response so no need for additional pace maker setting changes.  
She was maintained on her home medications metoprolol succ 100 daily and verapamil ER 240mg daily.
She will need to take cephalexin 500mg x 5 days for prophylaxis post-procedure.
. 
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pt has long history of atrial fibrillation complicated by tachy-brady syndrome.  
Pt suffered TIA/CVA in
[**Month (only) 958**]
that was atributed to a fib.  
During hospitalization, pt remained in a fib and was managed on her home medications of verapamil ER 240 mg PO daily, metoprolol succinate 100 mg PO daily, and warfarin 2.5/3.75 mg PO daily. 
She will be continued on warfarin for one month and then plan on chemical conversion with amiodarone. . 
CHRONIC ISSUES . 
# HYPERTENSION: Pt remained normotensive during hospitalization and was maintained on home medications: metoprolol succinate 100 mg PO daily, verapamil ER 240 mg PO daily . 
# FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: Patient has had recurrent fevers for several months, though work-up to date has been unrevealing (negative CT torso, negative TEE, cultures negative, s/p empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics).
Pt remained afebrile during hospitalization with no leukocytosis. .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt was full code.  
She will need follow up in device clinic for monitoring of pacemaker, along with close cardiology follow up for eventual attempted conversion with amiodarone.
Concerning the care her pacemaker, she should avoid lifting left arm above shoulder height for the next 2 weeks.
She also needs to take care to keep incision site clean and dry.  
She has a 5 day course of antibiotics to complete.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms.
[**Known lastname 111653**],
It was a pleasure caring for you while you were in the hospital. 
You were admitted after your pacemaker placement because of a pneumothorax (small leakage of air) in your left lung.
Thorax surgery was consulted and placed a pigtail catheter to remove the air.
Your lung expanded and the catheter was successfully removed.
Your pacemaker was adjusted appropriately and you recovered well from the procedure.
You will be discharged with a 5 day course of antibiotics and scheduled to follow up with cardiology and device clinic.
Concerning the care of your new pacemaker, you should avoid lifting your left arm above shoulder height for the next 2 weeks.  
Also, you can shower, but keep the incision where the pacemaker was paced dry.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
1.
please start taking cephelexin for 5 days
2.
please take oxycodone and/or tylenol as needed for pain
3.
please take docusate and/or senna as needed for constipation, which may be a side effect of the oxycodone.

Chief Complaint: HA, dizziness, LE numbness and weakness
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture x2
History of Present Illness:
Pt.
is a 24 y/o with a history of spinal stenosis s/p L5-S1 laminectomy who we are consulted for LE weakness and numbness.
Pt.
was in his USOH until Monday, 6 days PTA, when he developed a bifrontal and retroorbital headache.  
It was a stabbing
[**2110-6-19**] 
pain that was relieved with Ibuprofen but recurred over the next several days.  
Pt.
reports no diplopia, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking or slurred speech, no ear pain, ear fullness, or trouble hearing with the headache.
Then on thursday morning when he woke up pt.
noticed nausea and dizziness.  
He describes this as a sensation that the room was spinning.  
It continued constantly for the next several hours, with no change with change in position.  
Because of these symptoms he presented to an OSH ED on thursday evening.  
There a Head CT was performed and was negative, and he was diagnosed with an ear infection and discharged home with Amoxicillin.
The next morning the dizziness continued, and pt.
reports that he threw up ~3 times that day.  
In the afternoon his mother gave him Dramamine for the nausea.  
After taking the Dramamine pt. 
developed lower abdominal pain.  
He also started noticing numbness in his legs and weakness in his legs that afternoon. 
He describes his legs "felt asleep" and like they had less sensation, did not notice any pins and needles.  
He felt like he had trouble walking, and fell once, and is not sure if this was 
[**1-14**] weakness, or [**1-14**] the numbness in his legs or his dizziness.
He did not notice any bowel or bladder incontinence or any saddle anesthesia.
He presented again to
the [**Location (un) **] ED on Saturday because of these new symptoms.  
There a foley was placed with 1100 cc out. 
The abdominal pain resolved after the foley was placed but the LE numbness continued.  
He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for lumbar imaging.

Imaging
MRI L-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:
The alignment of the lumbar spine is unremarkable.
There is evidence of disc degenerative changes with disc desiccation involving the L2/3 through L5/S1 disc interspaces.
Post-surgical changes from previous laminectomy at L5/S1 are identified.
The conus is situated at T11/12.
The central canal appears congenitally small throughout.
However, no significant central canal stenosis is identified.
At L2/3, there is a mild central disc bulge without evidence of central canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.
At L3/4, there is a small central disc herniation associated with a central bulge without evidence of significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
At L4/5, there is a small left paramedian disc bulge without evidence of central canal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing.
At L5/S1, there is a small central disc bulge with an associated annular tear.
Post- laminectomy changes are identified.
There is no central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:
Congenitally small central canal with multilevel disc degenerative changes and a small disc herniation at L3/4. 
No evidence of significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 24 y/o with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis who presents with HA, nausea and dizziness, LE weakness and numbness, and urinary retention.
His exam is significant for loss of sensation with a T7 sensory level and bilateral IP weakness.
He has brisk LE reflexes which makes [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**]
[**Location (un) **] unlikely as a cause of LE weakness.
It is difficult to localize all of his symptoms with one lesion.
It is possible that dizziness and vertigo are
[**1-14**]
labrynthitis as suggested and are unrelated to his LE symptoms.
If vertigo is related to LE weakness there would have to be a multifocal process affecting the cerebellar vermis and thoracic spine.
Given his T7 level there is concern for a thoracic lesion, either from spinal stenosis, disc herniation, ADEM or infectious myelitis.

1.
NEURO: Workup included a lumbar puncture with RBC 21 and WBC 166 with lymphocytic predominance (prot 72, gluc 60).
MRI Head, C, and T spine with contrast that showed increased T2 signal at multiple C and T levels and cerebellar peduncle, medulla.
EMG was consistent with spinal process and did not show demyelination peripherally.
Differential diagnosis included infectious, postinfectious and inflammatory.
Infectious:
Patient was covered with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Acyclovir.
Per ID recommendation, Ampicillin was added to cover for Listeria given brainstem involvement.
Lyme titer was preliminarily positive on
[**Doctor First Name **]
however negative on confirmatory Western Blot.
Inflammatory:
ESR and CRP were normal.
There were no oligo-clonal bands in CSF.
ACE level normal.
Other: B12 was normal.
Treatment:
Patient was started on solumedrol 1g IV q24 on 
[**2106-9-14**]
for total of 14 day course.
He was switched to prednisone
[**9-21**] then resumed solumedrol [**9-22**]
when repeat MRI brain showed increased inflammation (restricted diffusion in enlarging lesion in L internal capsule measuring ~1 cm.
New lesion in L middle cerebellar peduncle.
Unchaged T2 hyperintensity in pontomedullary junction and nonenhancing T2 hyperintensity noted in cervical and thoracic cord).
Repeat MRI of head, C and T spine were improved on
[**9-27**];
although T2 hyperintense lesions remain within the left internal capsule, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and at the pontomedullary junction, all of the lesions are considerably improved and show no mass effect or enhancement.
Marked interval improvement in the appearance of T2-signal abnormalities in the cervical and thoracic cords, including reduced expansile mass effect among the cervical lesions.
Repeat LP performed by fluro on
[**2106-9-29**] 
showed RBC
[**Numeric Identifier 68969**] WBC 671 Prot 136* Gluc 84 which shows improvement.
Oligoclonal bands were again negative in the CSF.
Final diagnosis was myelitis/rhombencephalitis of unclear etiology.
Based on this admission, we were unable to differntiate between ADEM versus first presentation of multiple sclerosis.
He will follow longitudinally with an outpatient neurologist who specializes in demyelinating diseases Dr. 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8760**].
2.
CV: Continued telemetry.
Cycled enzymes which were negative x3.
3.
ID: Infectious disease was consulted.
Patient was started on Ceftriaxone on
[**9-13**]
and will complete a 28 day course to cover for Lyme CNS infection given the initial positive
[**Doctor First Name **]
test.
He will need to have his Lyme titer repeated which will be done in [**Hospital **] clinic as an outpatient after completion of this antibiotic course.  
Vancomycin that was initially started on
[**9-13**]
was eventually discontinued on
[**9-14**] when CSF cultures returned as negative.
Ampicillin/gentamicin was added for Listeria coverage. 
Ampicillin course will be for 5 wks (started [**9-
13**]-)
and he completed a gentamicin x10 day course ([**Date range (1) 68970**]).
Azithromycin was also added to cover Mycoplasma and subsequently discontinued when serum IgM titers were negative.
Acyclovir was also started for HSV covered and discontinued when HSV PCR returned as negative.
Final CSF results included: culture NEG, Fungal culture NEG; Histoplasma Antigen NEG; crypto antigen NEG. 
Additionally, serum results included: cryptococcal antigen negative, CMV negative, Toxo negative, HBV immune, HCV negative, Mycoplasma pneumoniae Antibody, IgG POS, IgM NEG; Histoplasma Ab
NEG, Blastomyces Ab NEG, HIV NEG, RPR NEG.
Stool:
Viral culture -
routine NEG, EBV IgM negative, positive IgG (immune).
PPD negative
[**9-15**] NEG and Monospot negative.
Test still pending at discharge: EEE, West
[**Doctor First Name **] 
Patient will follow-up in [**Hospital **]
clinic as an outpatient.
4.
GI: Patient developed severe constipation requiring daily disempaction x3 days.
Patient had nausea and vomitting requiring him to be NPO and NGT was placed to intermittent suction. 
Protonix QD was started.
KUB was negative for obstruction and suggested gas filled loops of colon.
Patient received Golytely and Milk of molasses enema with moderate results.
GI was consulted and recommended gastrogaffin enema
[**2106-9-23**] which did not show an obstruction and suggested paresis of the colon. 
Patient had small amount of vomit that was gastrocult postive however his Hct remained stable and HD stable.
Per GI, felt likely d/t irritation of stomach lining from NGT and suggested increasing to Protonix
[**Hospital1 **].
If patient did not improve, would have given IV neostigmine x1 however on
[**9-24**]
, patient started having spontaneously bowel movements.
At that time, he was on lactulose TID, dulculax PR
[**Hospital1 **]
among additional bowel medications.
Patient was advanced slowly and was tolerating a regular diet at discharge.
His stools continue to be loose and bowel regimen was gradually decreased.
5.
HEME: Patient's platelet count began gradually downtrending during this hospital course with unclear etiology.
Platelet count will need close following and HIT antibody was positive. 
All heparin products were held.  
This should be confirmed by serotonin release assay.
Consider alternative method for prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.
Careful medication review for medication induced thrombocytopenia needs to be performed and patient should be switched to alternative medications as indicated.
6.
PULM: On HD #2, patient had increasing tachypnea and work of breathing on the afternoon so was in admitted to the Neuro intensive care unit for monitoring between
[**9-13**] to [**9-16**].
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.  
Chest CT noncontrast to r/o parenchymal disease was negative and just showed left-sided atelectasis.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo woman with PMH of diet controlled DM2, HTN, breast ca s/p surgical resection and XRT who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital3 4107**] for STEMI.  
Patient was in her USOH until 1 week prior to presentation at
[**Hospital3 **]
when she began having cough productive of yellow-colored sputum tinged with specks of blood, also noted fevers/chills, some SOB with exertion.  
The patient was started on Levaquin as an outpatient 3 days prior to presentation which did not alleviate her sxs. 
She denies any SOB w/ exertion prior to onset of cough and fevers, orthopnea, PND, chest pain/pressure, palpitations.  
Does have some LE edema which she attributes to knee surgery. 
Patient presented to

Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.  
PTCA of  vessel.
3.
PCI of the mid LAD.
4.
Right groin hematoma .
TTE (
[**4-24**]):
The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. 
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.  
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the antero-septum, anterior wall distal LV/apex.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve is not well seen. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
.
CXR (
[**4-24**]):
Multifocal consolidation in right lung, in keeping with the provided history of pneumonia.  
Followup radiographs are suggested to confirm resolution. .
Brief Hospital Course:
. 
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:
Pt had STEMI in anterior leads on presentation, underwent cardiac cath
[**2134-4-24**]
with stent placed in lesion in LAD (right after D1).  
Initially maintained on integrilin, but it was discontinued postcath in setting of a groin hematoma. 
Cardiac enzymes trended down, peak CK 1479 on admission.  
The patient was chest pain free for the remainder of her stay.  
Her hematoma and Hct were stable and no bruit was auscultated.  
She was discharged on ASA, Plavix, Toprol XL, lisinopril, and high-dose Lipitor. .
B. Rhythm:
Pt had VFib arrest at OSH, successfully cardioverted, likely secondary to ischemia.  
At baseline, has borderline long QTc at 468.  
Also concern for arrythmia given syncope hx (see below).  
As VF arrest was in the setting of acute STEMI, she was not felt to meet criteria for ICD from that standpoint.  
QT prolonging medications were avoided.  
EP consult for syncope workup as below. .
C. Pump:
Unknown EF.  
Pt clinically appeared volume overloaded on admission, with elevated JVD, and crackles in lungs.  
ECHO 
[**4-24**]
demonstrated EF=25%, anterior WMA consistent with an LAD lesion, and apical akinesis.  
She was diuresed with prn IV Lasix.  
She was started on IV heparin for apical akinesis.  
EP evaluated her and recommended repeat TTE in 1 month, with ETT-T wave alternans and signal average ECG-EP study to determine if she qualifies for ICD per MADIT II criteria.  
She was discharged on Toprol XL, lisinopril, and Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge, with an INR check later that week. . 
# Syncope:  Pt reports long history of syncope, generally without prodrome, and with significant injuries with fall (i.e. hitting head, breaking ankle, etc.).  
The story was felt to be concerning for arrythmia.  
MRI/A showed no significant vertebrobasilar stenosis.  
EP was consulted, but flet her history was more consistent with vasovagal vs. hypoglycemic episodes.  
She was discharged to continue further workup as per PCP. 
. 
# ID/Respiratory:  Patient presented to the outside hospital with evidence of R sided pneumonia.  
Repeat CXR here was consistent with RML vs RUL pneumonia.  
She was transferred on levaquin and Cefazolin, but was found to have a borderline prolonged QTc.  
Therefore, she was switched to Ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  
As azithromycin can also prolong QT, it was discontinued as well.  
She wa safebrile with a normal WBC count, and was weaned off O2.  
Cultures were negative.  
She was discharged on cefpodoxime for 5 more days, to complete a 14-day course of antibiotics. 
. 
# HTN:  On atenolol, hydralazine, enalapril, HCTZ, and amlodipine for BP control at home.  
She was changed to metoprolol and captopril for easier titration.  
Her other antihypertensives were held in an effort to pursue titration of her beta blocker and ACE-i.  
She was discharged on Toprol XL and lisinopril. 
.

[**2107**].
She presented to the emergency department with diabetic ketoacidosis. .
1. DKA: Initial glucose in ED of 1157 with an anion gap of 23. 
Patient was initially admitted into the MICU for treatment of DKA.  
Glucose levels quickly corrected to 200 range and the anion gap normalized.
She was transitioned to Lantus and sliding scale regimen.  
She was monitored in the ICU overnight and was transferred to the medical floor the following afternoon. 
[**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted for assitance with her insulin levels and recommended a regimen of 20 units of Lantus every morning.
The precipitant of DKA was unknown.
Patient had no evidence of infections or acute coronary syndrome.
2.
ESRD s/p renal transplant in
[**2107**].
On admission, Cr 1.9, likely secondary to intravascular depletion in the setting of DKA.  
On discharge, creatinine was 1.0.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF OVERVIEW:
52 yo male with h/o diabetes, HTN, depression, anxiety disorder,CAD s/p MI in
[**2160**] PTCA [**2161**] to RPL, cypher stenting RCA
[**2168**] (repeat cath in [**7-/2168**]
with no flow limiting disease), and PVD complaining of worsening LLE pain.  
Pt was admitted for cath for possible stenting of the L iliac artery.  
He was found to have a SBP in the 60's on presentation to the cath
[**Year (4 digits) **].  
The catheterization was conducted, and the L iliac was totally occluded.  
No intervention was performed.  
S/p LE cath
he was tx'd to the CCU for monitoring.  
His BP returned to the low 100's and he was tx'd to the floor.  
He was stable overnight on the floor and was restarted on a small dose of his home BB and discharged in good condition. .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.
Hypotension:
The pt was hypotensive in the cath
[**Year (4 digits) **] presenting from home.  
It was thought that this was most likely 
[**2-28**]
dehydration as patient said he has been taking decreased PO and had been NPO after MN for the procedure.
However, after vigorous hydration in the [**Month/Day (2) **] with 5L of saline, he remained hypotensive.
Blood cultures, U/A, urine culture were negative. 
Cortisol in AM was 6.6, which is not diagnostic, so a cortisol stim test was conducted, which revealed a normal response.  
HCT remained stable.  
Iron studies and hemolysis labs revealed no abnormalities.  
CE's remained flat.  
In the CCU, all antihypertensives were held.  
Seroquel was also held as it has been implicated in orthostatic hypotension.  
No definitive determination of the cause of the hypotension was revealed, but the BP was stable and was tx'd to the floor overnight.  
His BP remained stable and his metoprolol was restarted at 12.5
[**Hospital1 **], a much lower dose.  
It was thought that he was likely dehydrated when he presented, as well as having taken all of his BP meds just prior to presentation.  
F/U was arranged for close monitoring of his BP and the pt was discharged in good condition. .
2.
PVD -
The pt was brought in for cath of the L iliac via the R iliac.  
He was tx'd to the CCU s/p cath with total occlusion of L ext iliac, no intervention.
The pt was continued on ASA, plavix.  
At the time of this hospitalization, there was no plan for OR. .
3. DM:  Hypoglycemics were held post-cath to prevent hypoglycemia and/or lactic acidosis.  
The pt was continued on a RISS and fingersticks were followed. .
4.
Psych: There were no issues at this hospitalization. 
Seroquel was held initially and restarted after the first night in the hospital.  
He tolerated his home dose well from a BP point of view.  
Of note, the pt was noted to have a bilateral UE/LE tremor throughout his body.  
This was thought to represent an EPS.  
It has been constant and unchanged for years per the pt. .
5.
Seizure disorder: Anti-epileptics were continued and there were no issues at this hospitalization. .
6.Anemia: There was a significant acute decrease in HCT after the cath
[**Last Name (LF) **],
[**First Name3 (LF) **]
recheck and get hemolysis labs and iron studies.  
There were no obvious sites of acute blood loss, and the patient was guaiac negative.  
He did not require any transfusions.  
It was later thought that this drop in HCT represented a significant dilutional anemia due to the 5L of fluid the pt received in the cath
[**First Name3 (LF) **]. .
7.
Ppx: The patient received mucomyst after his procedure for kidney protection.
9.
Codae status: The patient remained full code during the course of this hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old quadriplegic male with indwelling Foley
[**Last Name (un) **] 
presents with urosepsis (E. coli bacteremia)
Brief Hospital Course:
1) Urosepsis:
The patient had [**2-1**]
blood culture bottles growing 2 species of E. coli on
[**7-6**] (both sensitive to levofloxacin). 
The most likely source of infection is urinary (given indwelling catheter), given positive urinalysis.
CXR was without infiltrate.
He was rapidly weaned of pressors in the intensive care unit and volume resuscitated, allowing for transfer to the general medical floor on
[**7-8**].
He was initially covered broadly with vanco/levo/gentamicin while in the ICU, which, following transfer to the general floor, was changed to levofloxacin and gentamicin.
He will continue levofloxacin to complete a 14 day course from the first negative blood culture.
By the time of discharge, he had completed a 7 day course of gentamicin (given incompletely treated initial Klebsiella UTI from
[**6-27**]).
2) Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the emergency
[****] for airway protection (given somnelence) and hypoxia.
CXR showed only mild pulmonary edema, and, following treatment with antibiotics, the patient's mental and respiratory status improved to the point where he was able to be extubated without difficulty
[**7-7**].
At time of discharge, his respiratory status is stable on room air.
3) Anemia:
Given drop in hematocrit to 23 on
[**7-7**] (thought to be secondary to hemodilution in the setting of volume resuscitation superimposed on anemia of chronic disease)
, the patient received 2 units of PRBC.
At time of discharge, hematocrit stable in the mid 30s.
His stool was occult blood negative, and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Vitamin B12 and folate were normal/high
4) Bilateral gluteal decubitus ulcers: The patient was maintained on air manage with aggressive wound care.
5) Quadriplegia: The patient was continued on home dose of Baclofen, along with physical therapy.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 17**]
[**Known lastname 22627**]
is a 89 year old woman with history of asthma and HTN who presents to the OSH after being found down in her home.  
Patient was found by her daughter in her bathroom.  
She was awake and conversant but was unable to state how she ended up on the ground and how long she had been there.  
Her daughter reports last talking to her mother on the evening of
[**7-28**] and that patient did not endorse any complaints or health concerns. 
EMS was called and brought her to an OSH. . 
In the OSH she underwent CT head which showed a subacute subdural hemorrhage with slight midline shift.
Patient was also found to have elevated calcium of 14.2 for which she was given several liters of normal saline and intranasal calcitonin. 
After her CT head she became increasingly more somnolent to the point that she was unresponsive to painful stimuli.  
She was pretreated with etomidate and vecuronium and intubated.  
After intubation she experienced hypotension and was given epi
[**12-14**] 
amp, 2 L normal saline, dilantin load, and ceftriaxone 1 g IV. 
She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation. . 
On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED
her vital signs were .  
Neurosurgery and trauma teams were consulted.
Her EKG on arrival was concerning for new ST elevations in V1 and V2.
A CODE STEMI was called. 
Decision was made that patient's current comorbidities did not make her a candidate for urgent catheterization.
Repeat EKGs showed some resolution of ST elevations.
A left CVL was placed. 
She received empiric vancomycin 1 g IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV, flagyl 250 mg IV, and 4 L NS IV prior to transfer to the ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old woman found down with a rapidly deteriorating mental status and septic shock physiology with a positive urinalysis. . 
Upon arrival to the ICU the patient??????s blood pressure began to drop.
She required continuous IVF delivered wide open via 2 lines simultaneously without adequate blood pressure response. 
Pressors were started.
Even with continuous IVF boluses, neosynephrine and levophed the patient maintained only borderline pressures.  
Her lactate continued to increase and her urine output declined.  
She remained unresponsive to pain.  
Her daughter
[**Name (NI) 1785**]
was called and it was recommended that she come to the hospital if possible.
Goals of care were discussed with the patient's daughter (health care proxy).  
She stated that the patient would want everything done if it would definitely bring her back to the quality of life that she had before.  
She stated the patient would want to be able to return to her home and live independently as she has.  
When I expressed to her daughter that this outcome could not be guaranteed and based on her current clinical status would be very unlikely, she stated that her mother would not want to continue with aggressive treatment.  
She stated that if her mother was not able to interact that she would not want to be kept alive by any artificial means.   
The decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.  
The daughter and her husband did not want to be at the bedside if her mother passed.
The patient had become increasingly edematous due to aggressive volume resuscition.  
The decision was made to discontinue IV fluids. 
At this time her blood pressures could not be sustained. 
Pressors were discontinued and patient became pulseless.
I was called to the bedside at 9:40am to evaluate the patient. 
She was unresponsive without response to pain or corneal reflex.  
She had no heart sounds and no audible blood pressure.  
She was pronounced dead at 9:47 and extubated.  
Her daughter was called and instructed that due to the short duration of hospitalization and the recent trauma that the medical examiner will have to be notified of her mother??????s death.  
The daughter declined elective autopsy but expressed understanding that there may be policies in place that would require a post-mortem examination.

Chief Complaint:
Breast pain
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: evacuation of right breast hematoma
[**2181-3-8**]
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation refractory to lopressor, amiodarone, felxanide and cardioversion who was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery service from
[**2181-2-13**] to [**2181-2-18**] for MINI MAZE procedure. 
On
[**2181-2-14**]
the patient underwent minimally invasive bilateral thoracoscopic epicardial pulmonary vein isolation with resection of left atrial appendage and autonomic ganglia stimulation and ablation. 
The patient's procedure was reported to
have been non-complicated.
There was noted to be difficulty surrounding pain control for which narcotics and toradol were required, the patient ultimately required a paravertebral block finally with good effect.
The patient was noted to develop rapid afib x 1 and was treated w/ IV lopressor and amiodarone with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm.
The patient was discharged to home on coumadin.     
The patient reports she was doing generally well post-discharge although she did notice some nausea and intolerance ot pain meds.
2 days ago the patient reports she was doing some routine cleaning around her home without difficulty using her right arm, later in the day she reports sneezing and coughing frequently with sense of sharp pain in her right breast during this.
The patient noted some ongoing pain, took a percocet and attempted to go to sleep.
She woke up at 2:00a.m. 
with ongoing pain and noted a palpable lump on her breast over area of pain.
The patient presented to the ED yesterday a.m. Her care was discussed with CT surgery with impression she may have some local bruising related to procedure and recommended outpatient follow up with pain control.
Apparently the patient represented because of onogoing pain. .
ED Course:
Vitals 97.3, 131/73, 70, 20, 100% RA.
In the ED the patient had an ultrasound performed with wet read revealing for
5.5 x 8.5 x 10 cm heterogeneous collection at 10 o'clock, 7 cm deep, medial to patient's incision concerning for a post-op seroma although super-infection not excluded.
This was noted not fluid filled, thereby may be difficult to drain.
Additionally, more diffusely, centered at 2 oclock, there is a large hypoechoic region approximately 12 x 13 cm, concerning for intra-mammary hematoma.
In the ED the patient was seen by CT surgery team, no note of this encounter is available for review. 
Per ED signout CT surgery did not feel admission was warranted and recommended outpatient follow up, holding coumadin until therapeutic.
ED felt patient's pain was difficult to control and recommended admission for this as well as concern for fellulitis.
I contact[**Name (NI)
**] CT surgery team when request was made for admission to medicine.
I confirmed that CT surgery team was not concerned about findings on ultrasound, did not recommend any INR reversal beyond holding coumadin.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 61 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation status post MINI MAZE who now presents with right breast pain with ultrasound revealing for post-op seroma as well as large hematoma.  
She was transferred to the cardiac surery service on
[**2181-3-6**].  
INR drifted down and the patient was brought to the operating room on
[**2181-3-8**]
for evacuation of right breast hematoma.  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in good condition.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  
She was transferred to the telemetry floor.  
The patient remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter throughout the hospital course.  
She was maintained on amiodarone and lopressor.  
Coumadin was discontinued.  
The patient did develop some dizziness and was found to have orthostatic hypotension.  
This resolved with a bolus of albumin and decrease in her beta blockade.  
She made progress and was discharged home on POD 4.  
By the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

MRSA SCREEN (Final
[**2199-3-8**]):       
POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
[**2199-3-8**]
Chest X-ray
INDICATION:
Volume overload, pneumonia, assessment for interval change.
COMPARISON:
[**2199-3-6**].
FINDINGS:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement of the reticular opacities.
Otherwise, the widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged. 
Unchanged small left pleural effusion, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course:
63 F w/ ESRD
[**2-21**]
IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant 
in [**2173**] on HD (TRS) through LUE AVF since [**2193**] who presented with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea admitted to ICU for emergent dialysis for volume overload and hyperkalemia.
The patient had resolution of her hyperkalemia and volume overload after HD and was transferred to the floor. 
. 
# Hyperkalemia: Patient was found to have K 7.4 with prolonged QRS and LBBB.
Hyperkalemia felt most likely due to missing HD on day prior to admission.  
Underwent emergent dialysis with normalization of her potassium level and QRS narrowing back to baseline.  
She was hemodialysed on
[**1-16**], and [**3-9**].
Plan for next HD session on
[**2199-3-12**]
to return to her normal T,Th,Sa HD schedule. 
. 
# Volume overload: Likely related to missing HD due to acute illness.  
On admission, weight was ~ 3kg higher than dry weight ~ 39.7 Kg.  
Patient underwent HD with 1.2 and 2.0 L in ultrafiltrate removed during first 2 inpatient sessions.  
Oxygen requirement of 2L was no longer needed after removal of excess fluid.  
Due to patient's anuria, she is dependent on HD and importance of maintening dry weight can not be emphasized more clearly.
At discharge, she was at her dry weight of 39KG. . 
# Hypoxia: Oxygen requirement of 2L on admission.  
Due to chest x-ray suggestive of questionable right middle lobe pneumonia, was started on vancomycin, cefepime and levaquin in setting of report of chills and cough for 2 days prior to admission.  
RML opacity improved with fluid removal during HD on review of repeat films.
Similar opacity on prior films has fluctuated with volume status.  
Given lack of leukocytosis and fever as well as resolution of oxygen demand after HD, antibiotics were discontinued upon transfer to the floor.  
She remained afebrile with minimal intermittant cough, felt to be non-infectious in nature. . 
# Diarrhea: Symptoms improved over hospital course.
Given residence in rehab facility and transient course, likely viral in nature.
Lack of fever or leukocytosis, and benign abdominal exam, made C. diff unlikely, so this was not checked.
# s/p mitral valve replacement: Pt is on coumadin with goal INR 3-
3.5.
INR was subtherapeutic at 1.8.
She was started on a heparin gtt to bridge and her coumadin was increased to 2mg with increase to supratherapeutic levels and subsequently held.  
She is being discharged on heparin gtt until she reaches therapeutic INR on Warfarin. 
. 
#Troponinemia: Likely related to renal failure in the setting of HD.
Patient denies chest pain.
EKG changes likely related to hyperkalemia.
Baseline trop is 0.4.
She was continued on her home baby aspirin. 
. 
# HLD: Continued statin. 
. 
# Afib: Currently in sinus rhythm.
Continued Amiodorone. . 
# Depression:
Continued Celexa.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
* INR -
GOAL 3.0-
3.5 for mechanical valve.
On heparin gtt, warfarin dosing titrated on daily basis as she is very sensitive to slight changes in dose. 
* ESRD -
Resume Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday HD schedule.  
On renagel, sevelamer, and sensipar 
* Cardiovascular -
restarted low-dose carvedilol, should be given after HD on HD days. 
* Goal dry weight is 39kg, which was her weight on discharge.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Baby
[**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **]
[**Known lastname 52416**]
, triple #1, is a 1,455 gm boy born at 32-
1/7 week's gestational age to a 35-year-old G6, P1-
4 mother, with prenatal screens of maternal blood type A+, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, cystic fibrosis screen negative, rubella immune.  
Chorionic villus sampling showed normal 46XY, 46XY, and 46XX karyotypes for the 3 triplets.  
The pregnancy was conceived with assistance of Clomid.
The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the day prior to delivery when she was noted to have spontaneous rupture of membranes and the onset of labor.  
She was admitted to 
[**Hospital3 **] where she was treated with bed rest, betamethasone, magnesium sulfate, and then transferred to 
[**Hospital6 256**] for further care.
Delivery was by C-section and was uncomplicated, done for footling breech presentation.  
Baby #1 emerged with good cry and tone with Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM:
Noted for vigorous infant who appeared appropriate for gestational age.  
Temperature 98.6, heart rate 144, respiratory rate 52, blood pressure 70/41, oxygen saturation 95% in room air, weight 1,455 gm (25th percentile), length 38.5 cm (15th percentile), head circumference 28 cm (25th percentile).  
Anterior fontanel was soft and flat with sutures mobile and normal facies.  
Palate was intact.  
Lungs were clear and equal with no retraction. 
Normal regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.  
Abdomen was soft with no organomegaly.  
Genitalia was normal for gestational age with testes palpable bilaterally.  
Normal tone.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS -
 1)
RESPIRATORY: [**Known lastname **] has remained comfortable in room air, typically saturating greater than 95%.  
He was initially started on caffeine in the first 2 days of life empirically. 
Caffeine was discontinued on
[**3-15**]
, he continued to do well in room air, saturating greater than 95%.  
Typically he has 0-
2 desaturation episodes per day.
2)
CARDIOVASCULAR:  
[**Known lastname **]
has maintained cardiovascular stability throughout his admission and has not been noted to have a murmur.  
He does have an intermittent sinus arrhythmia.
3) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  He was initially NPO and received peripheral parenteral nutrition.  
His enteral feedings were advanced without problem and are currently at 150 cc/kg/d of Premature Enfamil supplemented to 30 kcal/oz plus ProMod all given by gavage.  
These feeds have been tolerated without problem.
4) GI:  Phototherapy was initiated on day of life #3 for a bilirubin of 10.1.  
Phototherapy was discontinued on
[**3-10**], with a bilirubin of 4.5.  
A follow-up bilirubin on 
[**3-12**]
was 6.1.  
At this time, he is clinically minimally jaundiced.  
Baby blood type is not known.
5) HEMATOLOGY/INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  
[**Known lastname **]
initially underwent a sepsis evaluation for premature delivery.  
Initial CBC showed a white blood cell count of 9.4, hematocrit 55, platelets 245.  
The differential showed 24% polys, 0% bands, 67% lymphocytes.  
Antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours of no growth in the blood culture.
On
[**3-12**] through [**3-15**]
, he had an increase in episodes of desaturations.  
A sepsis evaluation was undertaken at that time which showed a white blood cell count of 12.9, hematocrit 48, platelets 395, with 23% polys, 66% lymphocytes, 0% bands.  
No antibiotics were initiated, and a blood culture drawn at that time was negative.  
Because there was some nasal congestion, an RSV was sent with direct immunofluorescence and was negative.  
Since then, he has had no infectious disease issues.
6) NEUROLOGY:  A head ultrasound was performed on
[**3-19**] 
and was normal.
7) SENSORY:  Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem response with normal results on
[**3-19**]
bilaterally.  
An ophthalmology exam was performed on 
[**3-22**] which showed immature retinal vasculature, zone

Brief Hospital Course:
This 56 yo woman, who experienced severe vertigo and N/V after a cough, was initially seen at
[**Hospital 189**]
Hospital, where she had signs of cerebellar dysfunction and was found to be in AF. 
Serial imaging studies there demonstrated a right cerebellar infarct.
Vascular studies including MRA and CTA were significant for a basilar artery thrombosis.
She was being treated with therapeutic lovenox (90mg
[**Hospital1 **]) and aspirin (325 daily).
She was also found to have a UTI and was started on levofloxacin.
Subsequently she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She was initially monitored in the neuro ICU.
She underwent CTA head and neck which confirmed the presence of a filling defect at the vertrbrobasilar junction and was thought to have a basilar thrombus.
She was started on coumadin and daily INRs were monitored.
Her last INR
[**7-31**]
was
1.6.
Echocardiography showed Suboptimal image quality.
Possible pulmonary arteriovenous malformations versus small intracardiac shunt with late passage of bubbles during Valsalva manuever. 
Normal left ventricular systolic function, but cannot exclude regional dysfunction due to poor acoustic windows.     
Pt was transferred to the stroke floor on
[**2142-7-24**], and
since then has been working with PT to try to regain her ability to walk without a sense of extreme vertigo.
She had had some isolated low grade fevers, and blood and urine were cultured and a chest XR was taken.
All of these returned negative.     
Currently the patient is with only mild nystagmus on lateral gaze and with some mild dysmetria on FNF b/l, somewhat worse on the right.
She is able to sit on the edge of the bed without difficulty and can stand up, however when she tries to take her first step she is quite vertiginous and nearly falls.
As there was some question of whether there was an orthostatic component to her vertigo on standing, she was given some gently IV hydration wiht NS at 100 mL/hr for 1.5 L starting on
[**7-31**].
She was discharged to a rehab facility on
[**2142-7-31**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107917**]
is a 71-year-old gentleman who is a plumbing contractor who has been followed for his aortic aneurysm which has now about 4.8 cm in diameter and has increased about 1 cm in the last year.
The patient was postponed for his surgery as he weighed some 225 pounds and went on a dieting regimen, losing almost 30 pounds down to a weight of 190.  
He has a history of a previous appendectomy and knee and shoulder arthroscopies. 
He has also had a hernia repair in the past.  
He is not a diabetic.  
He has no evidence of claudication and has no history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:
On physical examination Mr. [**Known lastname 107917**]
was a healthy-looking gentleman showing the effects of some recent blood loss.  
He had no bruits over his carotid, femoral or distal pulses.  
His distal pulses were normal, especially his dorsalis pedis pulses which were 4+.  
He had no evidence of popliteal aneurysm, but he did have approximately a 4.5-cm X 4.8-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:
He had undergone outpatient angiography which had disclosed a small left lower pole renal artery branch that came off below the main renal arteries.
Records show that on
[**12-27**]
he also had a exercise thallium test that showed no significant fixed or reversible perfusion defects with normal wall motion and an ejection fraction of 71%.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:
His laboratory tests were all within fairly normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
We felt he was a good candidate for open aneurysm repair which was discussed quite thoroughly with him.  
On the day of admission, the patient underwent elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.  
He had fairly marked calcification in the infrarenal aorta as well as the aortic bifurcation.  
The left lower pole renal artery was excised with a Carrel patch and placed into the side of the 18-mm Dacron graft which was placed from his infrarenal aorta to his aortic bifurcation.  
The patient was given about 1000 units of cellsaver blood with 4500 cc of crystalloid.
His postoperative course following this procedure was really quite uneventful.  
He had some low blood pressures, probably on the basis of his epidural catheter.  
His hematocrit drifted down to around the 40 area, and over the course of the next few days he underwent a rapid convalescence from his aneurysm repair.  
His blood count on
[**2-6**]
was actually a hematocrit of 30, with a creatinine of 0.6, and a blood urea nitrogen of 8.
He will be discharged on some Tylenol with codeine for pain control.  
His abdominal incision was healing well, and in any other way he was eating and moving his bowels at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
OPERATION:
Open repair with an 18-mm tube graft with Carrel patch of the left lower pole renal artery to the site of the graft.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:
The patient will be seen in followup in approximately one week's time for removal of his staples. 
The patient will be seen in the outpatient department for follow up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 10%, who presented with worsening orthopnea and dyspnea.  
He has had multiple recent admissions to the Cardiovascular service.  
In
[**2134-4-14**]
, he was admitted with complete heart block and a DDD pacemaker was placed.  
Earlier this month, in
[**2134-5-15**]
, he was readmitted with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.  
He was transiently in the Coronary Care Unit on dopamine for one day before being transferred to the floor when his heart failure medications were gradually added back on.  
He was just discharged on
[**2134-5-19**].  
He has been followed closely by his cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 2031**], who had been able to increase his lasix back to his previous outpatient dose of 80 mg by mouth twice a day.  
Enalapril had been continued at 10 mg by mouth once daily and Toprol XL had been held.  
Today he complains of dyspnea on exertion and progressive orthopnea for the last three to five days.  
He has had increasing peripheral edema but, over the last two or three days, he thinks this has improved.  
His weight was 191 pounds yesterday, although he claims his dry weight is approximately 180 pounds.  
He felt extremely fatigued.  
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  
No recent antibiotic use.
No dysuria, no chest pain.  
He did have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and a mild cough.  
He admitted to a decreased appetite.  
Because of his feeling generally unwell, he called his niece to bring him into the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ethanol-induced; ejection fraction of approximately 10%.  
An echocardiogram in
[**2134-5-15**]
showed an ejection fraction of less than 20%, superior left ventricular dilation, severe global right ventricular and left ventricular hypokinesis, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
2.  Coronary artery disease, although he had a normal cardiac catheterization in
[**2128**]
3.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
4.  
Asthma
5.  Complete heart block status post DDD pacemaker in
[**2134-5-15**]
6.  Tophaceous gout, recently in the fourth toe on the left foot
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency progressing to acute renal failure in
[**2134-5-15**]
, now resolved.  
His baseline creatinine is approximately 1.5 to 2.0.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth once daily, Vasotec 10 mg by mouth once daily, Coumadin 3 mg by mouth once daily, Colace 100 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 80 mg by mouth twice a day, aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily, Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled four times a day, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth once daily, Toprol XL 12.5 mg by mouth once daily that was on hold, Glyburide 10 mg by mouth twice a day.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

[**Known lastname 11752**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Afebrile, heart rate 80, blood pressure 90/54 (this is his baseline blood pressure), respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  
In general, an elderly male, lying in bed, comfortably, speaking in full sentences, in no acute distress.  
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, normocephalic, atraumatic, oropharynx clear, jugular venous distention approximately 10 cm.  
Chest:  Bilateral basilar rales that he is known to have at baseline, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, and S3 are heard.  
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  
Extremities:  2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:
White count 7.2,  with a normal differential.  
Hematocrit 33.8 with a mean cell volume of 79. 
Platelets 235, INR 2.4, PTT 36.4.  
Chem 7:  Sodium 134, potassium 5.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 53, creatinine 2.3, glucose 182.  
Initial CK was 73.
Electrocardiogram:
He was AV paced at 80 beats per minute with a left bundle branch block.  
There were no changes compared to previous electrocardiogram.  
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with mild upper zone redistribution.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 69-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy, who presents with increasing dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea, consistent with fluid overload.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  
Cardiac:  Because of the patient's acute decompensated congestive heart failure, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.  
Aspirin was continued.  
In order to more accurately assess the patient's fluid status in light of his surprisingly clear lung examination, the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization for a right heart catheterization.  
This showed marked increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure up to 30 mm Hg, with a mean right atrial pressure of 25, consistent with marked fluid overload. 
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.82.  
Milrinone intravenous was given, and the wedge pressure decreased to 22, with an increase in the cardiac output to 2.62.  
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit with his Swan-Ganz catheter in place, for further management and aggressive diuresis.  
Initially this was attained with a milrinone drip to improve cardiac output, and intravenous lasix to reduce pre-load.  
However, the patient's blood pressure did not tolerate this regimen, so dopamine was added for pressor support.  
The lasix drip was increased to 40 mg/hour, and Zaroxolyn was added, with good effect.  
The patient diuresed approximately 2 liters over two days on this regimen.
With hopes of weaning the dopamine, Natrecor was added as an augmentation to the lasix.  
The patient continued to diurese, however, the dopamine was continued for low blood pressure. 
It should be noted that we maintained the dopamine dose at 3 mcg/kg/minute because, at higher doses, the patient experienced considerable ectopy.
By hospital day seven, the lasix drip had been converted to twice a day lasix, the milrinone was turned off, Aldactone was added, and Zaroxolyn was continued.  
The patient was given Enalapril 2.5 mg by mouth twice a day intermittently, but this was often held for low blood pressure.  
It was felt that, by hospital day seven, the patient had returned to his normal dry weight.
The patient's electrocardiogram showed evidence of ventricular dyssynchrony.  
Specifically, the QRS duration was prolonged.  
Therefore, the Electrophysiology service was consulted to consider conversion  to biventricular leads provide biventricular synchronization.  
It was decided that this would be performed once the patient was euvolemic.  
As of this dictation, the plan is to perform this procedure on 
[**6-7**].
The patient's amiodarone was continued for his history of atrial fibrillation.  
The dose was decreased to 200 mg by mouth once daily.  
The patient was also anticoagulated both for the history of atrial fibrillation as well as the low ejection fraction.
2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had few pulmonary symptoms after he was adequately diuresed.  
Supplemental oxygen was provided, and he had excellent oxygen saturation.
3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had a temperature spike to 102 on hospital day number seven.  
Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and the results were still pending at the time of this dictation.  
Empiric vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl were started.  
The patient's central line was discontinued to account for the possibility of line sepsis.  
These antibiotics should be continued until the culture results are known, with tailoring of the antibiotic regimen for the appropriate pathogen or, in the event of a negative culture workup, the antibiotics should be discontinued.
4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a history of constipation, and this was a problem for him during this hospitalization.  
He required an aggressive bowel regimen. 
We also continued Protonix.
5.  Prophylaxis:  The patient received heparin subcutaneously for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, as well as Protonix as mentioned above.
6.  
Code status:  The patient is full code.
DISPOSITION:
As of this dictation, the plan is for transfer back to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] after stabilization of the patient's blood pressure and conversion of DDD pacer to biventricular mode. 
The remainder of the hospital course will be dictated in a separate dictation summary addendum.

ADDENDUM:
On
[**2154-6-16**]
, the patient developed an episode of delirium.  
At that time, he spiked a fever.  
A chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating a new right upper lobe and right lower lobe consolidation consistent with a pneumonia.  
The most likely etiologies were aspiration versus pseudomonal as the patient was on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl at the time of his fever spike.  
The patient was changed to Zosyn/gentamicin and started on a 14 day course.  
He defervesced in less than 24 hours and was doing quite well. 
All cultures are negative to date.  
A high level of narcotics was also felt to possibly be a culprit in the patient's delirium.  
Therefore, narcotics were minimized, i.e., to be used on a p.r.n.
basis only and the patient was started on Ibuprofen 800 mg p.o.
t.i.d.
with meals as he was already on hemodialysis.
The patient's alertness is crucial in avoiding aspiration, despite negative speech swallow evaluation and video fluoroscopic study.
Surgery recommended dry sterile gauze dressing changes daily and elevation of the right leg.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85524**]
is a 27 yo male with PMH of bipolar disorder, narcotics addiction on methadone, remote motorcycle accident with resulting seizure disorder on dilantin until 6 months ago, who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on one week ago in respiratory failure.  
He initially had a sore throat but then developed productive cough, DOE, which was followed by fever and then respiratory distress. . 
In the ED there, they felt he was septic
and he was intubated. 
He had large bilateral consolidations and sputum grew group A strep and strep pneumoniae.  
A CT chest without contrast on
[**6-15**] 
showed confluent consolidation with associated air bronchogram involving both lower lobes and there is also involvement of the middle lobe with patchyinfiltrate in the upper lobes, pleural fluid on the right and left.  
He was on norepinephrine for BP support which was weaned on the days following admission as he received aggressive IV hydration.  
He received a dose of IVIG because of his history of splenectomy and was placed on quadruple antibiotics with levoquin, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, and vanc until the speciation and sensitivities returned, at which time he was placed on ceftriaxone for a planned 14 day course.  
Legionella urinary antigen also returned negative so his levofloxacin was stopped.  
An HIV test was reportedly negative.  
HCV was positive.  
He required large doses of fentanyl and versed to remain comfortable on the vent and remained on his home methadone.  
On Thursday, he was extubated. 
He has been afebrile since
[**6-21**] and his O2 sat
has been in the mid 90s on
[**7-7**]
liters. 
. 
His MS was noted to be off and he had a reported seizure on Saturday described as his eyes rolling back into his head with a short episode of LOC.  
He was started on dilantin 100mg TID. 
Since then, his physician describes episodes where his eyes will roll back in his head and he will have tremors, but he will come out of it if he is spoken to.  
A CT head was normal over the weekend.  
For that reason, he is being transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].  
He is currently on 10L O2, but there has not been much effort to wean his O2. . 
His WBC prior to transfer was 23 with 51 neutrophils, 10 bands, 15 lymphs, HCT 35.5. 
. 
. 
On the floor, he is tachycardic, alert but only intermittently following commands.  
He can not give a history because he is not talking.

This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations; however, it captured several events suggestive of ongoing seizure activity bifrontally with a left predominance which became much less frequent in the second half of the recording.
There were several sharp waves seen in the left temporal area suggestive of increased irritability in this region.
The background activity improved substantially over the time of the recording suggestive of a resolving mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85524**]
is a 27 yo male with PMH of seizure disorder
[**3-3**] 
head trauma, narcotic addiction, who was transferred from
[**Hospital1 6591**] for further management of seizures and altered mental status following a group A strep/strep pneumo pna requiring intubation. 
. 
# respiratory failure: respiratory failure in the setting of group A strep and strep pneumo pna.  
He was extubated on
[**6-18**] 
still required 10L O2 by NC on transfer, though little previous attempt was made to wean.  
Severe strep pneumo pna is uncommon in healthy 27
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
underlying immunocompromise may be considered, but he also grew group A strep which can cause a severe pna in young immunocompetent individuals.  
He was HIV negative during his OSH stay.
Continued ceftriaxone during his micu stay, and fever curve decreased.
His O2 was progressively weaned down as his mental status improved, but he did require occasional aggressive chest PT to mobilize secretions.  
He was weaned to room air and was able to ambulate without supplemental oxygen.
He completed a 2 week course of IV ceftriaxone after a PICC was placed.  
The PICC was removed prior to discharge. . 
# MS changes/seizure: Reported seizure at OSH 2 days prior to transfer, was started on dilantin.  
He has a history of a seizure disorder
[**3-3**]
head trauma from motocycle accident.
He presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] with markedly dilated pupils, decreased interraction and intermittent command following, hyperreflexia with LE clonus, very concerning for acute withdrawal state,
with possible intermittent seizures.
He had been getting large doses of versed and fentanyl while intubated at OSH (up to 40mg/400mcg/hr!, and his home methadone has been reduced recently.
Neuro and psychiatry were consulted and agreed with withdrawal picture.
His methadone dose was doubled, and he was put on standing ativan and clonidine.
He was also loaded with dilantin (low levels here) and monitored on EEGs, which were reported are markedly encephalopathic with possible intermittent seizures.
Over his MICU course his mental status markedly improved with the above measures, making withdrawal and intermittent seizures the working diagnosis.  
He was put back on his home dose of 150mg methadone daily, and given several extra doses of Dilantin to get his level to a therapeutic level.
He was also restarted on his home Klonopin, clonidine and Seroquel.  
He was eventually discharged on Dilantin 100/200/200 mg daily, for a total of 500mg a day split into separate doses.  
We discussed the dilantin dosing with his PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you Mr.
[**Known lastname 13144**].
You were transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] intensive care unit because your mental status was persistently altered.  
You were likely withdrawing from your sedative medications and pain killers and having seizures.  
Your mental status has improved after restarting your home medications and starting Dilantin (phenytoin), an anti-seizure medication.  
Your pneumonia continued to improve, and you completed a two-week course of ceftriaxone, an antibiotic.  
You are now ready to go home. 
. 
You were started on Dilantin (phenytoin) three times a day.
Take 1 pill at 8am, 2 pills at 2pm and 2 pills at 10pm for a total of 5 pills a day.
It is very important that you continue taking this medication to prevent seizures.  
The Dilantin levels in your blood need to be monitored to be sure they stay in the right range.  
Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 29247**]
will check these levels.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.
[**Known lastname 16646**]
was admitted and underwent persantine MIBI on 
[**2190-7-16**] which revealed a moderate fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall -
no reversible perfusion defects were identified. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 56%.
The EKG portion showed approximately 1 mm lateral and apical ST depressions which were 0.5 mm additional over baseline ST depressions.
She experienced no angina or shortness of breath. 
Further evaluation included an echocardiogram which found a severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets, severe AS with mild AI.
The aortic peak and mean gradients were 73 and 46 mm Hg.
There was severe mitral annular calcification with mild to moderate ([**11-
22**]+) mitral regurgitation.
Her LVEF was estimated at 60%.
The ECHO was also notable for mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Subsequent cardiac cathterization on
[**2190-7-19**]
revealed severe three vessel disease and severe AS.
The [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 109**]
was estimated at 0.7 cm2 with a gradient of 49 mmHg.
Angiography showed a 60% ostial left main stenosis; 50% lesion in the mid LAD, 90% obtuse marginal stenosis, and 80% lesion in the RCA.
Given her renal insufficiency, no LVG was performed.
Based on the above findings, cardiac surgery was consulted.
Further evaluation included vein mapping and carotid ultrasound which found no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.
On
[**2190-7-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed an aortic valve replacement with a 19-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve and coronary bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
There were no complications.
Postop TEE showed no AI, 1+ MR with an LVEF of 50%.
After the operation, she was brought to the CSRU.
Within 24 hours, she was extubated.
She maintained good hemodynamics but initially experienced low urine output. 
Her urine output eventually improved with volume and PRBC's.
She was transfused to maintain hematocrit over 30%.
Her renal function remained relatively stable -
creatinine peaked to 2.4. 
She gradually started on Lasix.
Over several days, her clinical status stabilized.
She was noted to be in a first degree AV block with occasional junctional episodes -
beta blockade was therefore initially withheld.
On postoperative day 7, she transferred to the SDU.
Periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted for which low dose betablockade was resumed.
K and Mg levels were monitored and repleted per protocol.
She remained mostly in a NSR.
Low dose beta blockade was continued.
Her last episode of AF was noted on POD #8.  
She continued to require diuresis.
By discharge, her oxygen saturations were 98% on 2L nasal cannula.
She was also noted to have a leukocytosis, white count peaked to 18K.
She remained afebrile.  
All lines were removed and cultures remained negative.
By discharge, her white count improved to 13K.
After several more days of obsrvation, she was cleared for discharge to rehab on POD #10.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 61 yo F with undifferentiated carcinoma in lung and liver who presents from an OSH after a fall at home.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-18**] -[**12-
25
**] with nausea and vomiting, thought to be due to his underlying malignancy.
His hospital course was complicated by a code STEMI which was due to a moderate size pericardial effusion requiring a brief stay in the CCU.
Pleural effusion was never tapped. 
Patient was set up to see outpatient oncologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] 
after discharge to discuss outpatient chemotherapy, but has not been to his appointment yet because he states he overslept that day. . 
Patient reports that he has been feeling more weak and tired at home.
he has not been eating and drinking well due to anorexia and lack of appetitite, and reports eating on average about 1 meal a day, usually only a
[**Location (un) 6002**].
He was at home when he felt he 'lost his balance' and fell to his knees the day of admission.
No head strike.
Denies any chest pain, palpitation, SOB, LH, or syncope prior to, during, or after the episode.
Did not loose his bowels or bladder.
No seizure activity.
Pt was not getting any PT at home.
He states due to his fatigue he does not walk around very much and mostly lies in bed or sits in a chair all day.
Pt also with some nausea and vomiting, but fairly well controlled with his prochlorperazine, and last episode was a few days ago.
He presented to an OSH (
[**Hospital3 417**])
where a CXR demonstrated a new pleural effusion.
Given 1 gram of Vancomycin and 1 gram of CFTX at OSH.  
He was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further management. . 
In the ED, VS were: 100.9 100 102/61 22 96% 3L.
Labs sig for
WBC of 48.3 (43.1 on discharge on
[**12-25**]), Hct of 22.5, lactate of
2.6, INR of 1.4.
Received no IVFs, Flagyl 500 mg IV x1, and 60 mEQ of PO K in the Ed.
While there, pt had one episode of AF with RVR to the 180s with associated hypotension with systolics down to 80s.
RVR broke with 10 of IV diltiazem and he was given 30 mg PO diltiazem immediately afterwards.
Pulsus measured as 
[**7-24**].
Bedside TTE done by ED showed moderate sized pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
CCU fellow was consulted for possible CCU admission, but did not think the current pericardial effusion was large enough to warrant CCU admission for pericardiocentesis or STAT TTE and declined the admission.
Heme-onc fellow was also consulted and declined OMED admission given recent medicine admit and that the patient had not yet established care with his new oncologist, and that chemotherapy would be unlikely at this time.

EKG
[**1-7**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of
[**2193-1-3**]
there is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
EKG
[**1-16**]:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ventricular premature beat.
Modest low amplitude T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of
[**2193-1-7**]
ectopy is now present.
Imaging:
CXR -
[**2193-1-1**] -
Large R sided pleural effusion, appear slightly worsened compared to
[**2192-12-22**]
CXR.
CXR
[**1-16**]:
1.
Persistent right basilar opacification and increased extent of lobulated pleural opacities suggesting enlarging pleural-based fluid collections and possibly burden of metastatic disease.
2.
Generalized but somewhat heterogeneous mild new opacification of the right lung in conjunction with increasing pleural opacities, which may represent atelectasis, the result of lymphatic obstruction, although pneumonia is not excluded.
[**2192-12-18**]
CT ABD W CONTRAST: 1.
Progression of large complex hepatic lesion which now occupies greater than 60% of the hepatic parenchyma.
Findings are concordant with recent biopsy results of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
At this point, there
are no imaging features suggestive of abscess.
2.
Increase in size and of numerous pulmonary nodules seen on limited views of the lung bases.
3.
New appearance of multiple mesenteric implants suggestive of metastatic disease.
TTE (
[**2191-12-23**]):
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion, primarily anterior to the right ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION:
Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function
TTE (
[**2192-1-4**]) 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse and brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free wall.
IMPRESSION:
findings are consistent with early cardiac tamponade
CT (
[**2192-1-3**])
FINDINGS:
The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of dissection.
The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without intraluminal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
The heart is normal in size.
A new pericardial effusion is moderate in severity, causing straightening of the ventricular septum and distortion and attenuation of the right atrium, concerning for tamponade physiology.
No pericardial nodularity is identified.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are new or enlarged including a 14-mm lower right paratracheal lymph node which is new.
Numerous non-pathologically enlarged upper paratracheal and thoracic inlet lymph nodes are new.
A right hilar lymph node is mildly enlarged measuring 11 mm, previously measuring 9 mm.
Previously identified pleural thickening and nodularity have rapidly progressed within the right hemithorax with numerous new pleural metastases identified and involving both the minor and major fissure.
Several areas of loculated pleural fluid are noted, most prominent along the paramediastinal pleural surface and within the major and minor fissures.
A new left pleural effusion is moderate in severity.
No pleural thickening or nodularity is noted within the left hemithorax.
Right lower lobe airspace consolidation is attributed to atelectasis. 
Multiple new pulmonary nodules are identified including a 6-mm left lower lobe nodule (400B:36), a 3-mm right lower lobe nodule (3:52), a ground glass 9-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (3:39), a 4-mm right upper lobe nodule (3:34) and a 4-mm right upper lobe nodule, consistent with pulmonary metastases.
There are no bony lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Multilevel degenerative changes noted throughout the spine.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, numerous low-density lesions within the liver have increased in size, most consistent with worsening hepatic metastases.
Findings are better characterized on prior CT abdomen dated 
[**2192-12-18**].
IMPRESSION:
1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.
Moderate pericardial fluid causing attenuation and distortion of the right atrium, concerning for tamponade physiology. 
Clinical correlation is essential, as reported in preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] on
[**1-4**] and 
discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 17316**] at 12:10 a.m. by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
3.
Marked interval progression of extensive pleural metastases in the right hemithorax, bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, all of which is consistent with worsening metastatic disease.
4.
Moderate left pleural effusion; no pleural nodules.
5.
Partially imaged numerous low-density lesions in the liver, demonstrating interval increase in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo man with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma who presented after a fall at home.
Poorly differentiated carcinoma: Noted on liver and pleural biopsies.
Presumed HCC with sarcomatoid growth.  
Cancer occupying more than 60% of liver, with metastatic disease to the pleural space.  
Family meeting held on
[**2193-1-4**]
as well as 
[**2193-1-8**]
to discuss goals of care.  
Medical professional team included oncology, palliative care specialists, general medicine physicians, and social workers.  
A discussion with pt and family outlined patient had a terminal disease, and further surgical or medical interventions would yield little benefit.  
Thus, he and his HCP decided that a long term care facility with hospice care was in his best interest, with goals of care focused on comfort. 
Placement was delayed and on
[**1-21**]
the patient was noted to be less alert and less responsive.
Through a discussion with
the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, the patient was made [**Name (NI) 3225**].
The patient expired shortly thereafter with his family at the bedside.
Cause of death was likely congestive heart failure related to malignant pericardial effusion secondary to advanced likely hepatocellular carcinoma.
The family declined autopsy.
Palliative Care:
the patient received anti-emetics, anxiolytics and narcotics for relief of symptoms prescribed with the guidance of the palliative care team.
Pleural effusion: Noted new pleural effusion on admission.  
Had bedside ultrasound by pulmonary team which illustrated metastatic disease in the pleural space, with no tapable effussion.  
No intervention was performed, as aspiration of fluid would not relieve symptomatology.
Pericardial effusion: Most likely malignant effusion in setting of known oncologic disease.
TTE's were concerning for early tamponade physiology.  
Considering effusion was most likely from a malignant etiology, tapping the effusion was declined by cardiology, as they felt a pericardial window was the most necessary intervention for relieving the fluid accumulation. 
Family meeting held, and pursuit of a pericardial window was deemed very aggressive, and would not change patient's overall prognosis given metastaic disease, and would contribute more morbidity than benefit.  
Thus, pericardial window was declined by the patient and HCP.  
[**Name (NI) **]
intervention was performed.  
The patient was monitored for worsening fluid accumulation or signs of tamponade.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient had episode of AF w/ RVR associated with hypotension in the ED on presentation.
Inciting etiology was unclear, but presumed to be due to irritation from pericardial effusion or fluid shifts in setting of persistent nausea and vomiting.  
Had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate while on the medical floors.  
Treated with 25 mg of metoprolol
[**Hospital1 **].  
For breakthrough RVR, responded well to 10 mg IV diltiazem push over 2 minutes. 
Hemodynamically stable for approximately 10 days prior to death with no known episodes of atrial fibrillation, although blood pressures consistently low with SBP's in the 80s-90's and DBP's in the 40-
60's.
Fall:
Likely mechanical in the setting of deconditioning/weakness from his malignancy versus dehydration from nausea/vomiting.
No history of any pre-heralding symptoms concernign for vasovagal, or neurologic etiology of his fall. 
EKG unremarkable, troponin negative x3.  
IVF was given.  
During hospitalization, decreased mobility secondary to deconditioning, anasarca, and weakness.  
Required assistance from bed to chair.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41684**]
was admitted pre-operatively to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Orthopedic Spine Surgery Service on
[**2123-2-17**] under the attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**]
for coumadin reversal.
His INR on admission was 2.1 and his coumadin was held.
He received vitamin K 10mg x 1 and 2U FFP prior to surgery.
He was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2123-2-18**] 
for the above procedure performed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**].  
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
He received 2U FFP and 3U RBC intra-operatively.
The procedure was without complication however due to long duration of surgery & EBL 1000cc he was taken intubated to the SICU postoperatively for monitoring.
Postop HCT was 33.5.
After the procedure his pacemaker interogated by cardiology.
Pnemoboots and SC heparin were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol.
Initial postop pain was controlled with IV dilaudid. 
He was extubated the following day without incident.
He had significant total body peripheral edema following surgery and was aggressively diuresed in the ICU for the first four days postoperatively with a goal of 1.5-
2.0L negative each day.
He tolerated the diuresis well.
Electrolytes were checked twice daily during this period and repleted as needed.
He did not have any signs of pulmonary edema and his respiratory status was stable on room air by POD#2.
He did have significant serous ooze from his surgical wounds for several days postop.
There was no purulance or erythema and this resolved gradually as his peripheral edema improved on diuresis.
His home coumadin dosing was restarted on POD#3 and followed with daily INRs.
His SC heparin was discontinued when INR>2.0.
His INR goal was make
2.0-
2.5 to minimize his risk of postop bleed and his home coumadin dose was decreased slightly.
He was noted to have some difficulty swallowing and a speech and swallow consult was obtained on POD#4 after he was transferred to the regular orthopaedic floor.
He was found to have coughing with all PO intake and it was felt that he was not safe to take food, liquid or oral medications.
An NGT was placed for delivery of medications and tube feeds.
Placement was confirmed on Xray and nutrition was consulted to tube feeding recommendations. 
Tube feeds were tolerated well.
Speech and swallow re-evaluated him on POD#6 and recommended that he be restarted on an oral diet of ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
He tolerated oral diet well and the NGT was removed the following day.
On repeat S+S evaluation he was advaced to ground solids and thin liquids under supervision.
Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate.
On POD#8 he was slightly orthostatic while OOB with PT.
His blood pressures normalized immediately when he was back in bed and his lasix was discontinued.
HCT was checked and was found to be 28.4.
On POD#9 his urine output was borderline.
His HCTZ was held and BUN/Cre were checked and were normal.
HCT was checked and was stable.
He recieved a 500cc NS bolus with improvement in urine output. 
Foley catheter remained in place until POD#10 for strict monitoring of I+Os.
A U/A was checked at the time of foley removal.
Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.
Upright Xrays of the spine were performed prior to discharge.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet of ground solids and thin liquids with aspiration precuations.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed the left ventricle had an ejection fraction of 60%, mild mitral regurgitation, and anterior apical hypokinesis.  
The left main was heavily calcified with an 80% mid and distal stenosis and a 70% ostial stenosis.  
The left anterior descending artery had a good target, large first diagonal, with an 80% origin stenosis.  
The left circumflex had a large ramus with no significant disease.  
The right coronary artery had no significant disease.  
She had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed, and Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**]
was consulted.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  
On the following day (on
[**11-25**])
, the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and reversed saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  
The cross-clamp time was 26 minutes.  
The total bypass time was 60 minutes.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit on Neo-Synephrine and propofol.  
She had a low cardiac output on the night of surgery and required milrinone and large amounts of fluid.  
The patient responded to this. 
She also was in atrial fibrillation and was started on an amiodarone drip.  
She remained intubated and was eventually weaned off her milrinone and was extubated on postoperative day three.  
She was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  
She was followed by Electrophysiology.  
She had been on flecainide prior to admission, but Electrophysiology preferred to have her on amiodarone.
She remained on the Unit.  
She had some hoarseness following extubation.  
She was seen by Ear/Nose/Throat who felt this was from her prolong intubation.  
She also had a swallowing study which she did well with.
On postoperative day six, the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed no clot in her ventricle.  
She then had cardioversion.  
Following cardioversion, she continued to go in and out of atrial fibrillation.  
She had not been receiving her Lopressor due to a low blood pressure.  
Her dose was then decreased.  
She then converted again into a sinus rhythm.  
She has been anticoagulated on heparin and Coumadin.
On postoperative day ten, the patient's heparin was discontinued as her INR was 2.  
She also had an increase in her creatinine.  
Her preoperative creatinine was 1.1 and went up as high as 1.9.

Sex: F
Service: NB
IDENTIFICATION:
Baby Girl
[**Known lastname 70079**]
#I is a 7.5 week old former 30-
5/7 week premature twin who is being discharged from
the [**Hospital1 69**]
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
HISTORY:
Baby Girl
[**Known lastname 70079**]
#I was born on
[**2192-12-5**] as the 1680 gram product of a 30-
5/7 week twin gestation pregnancy to a 34 year-old gravida I, para 0 to II mother. 
Prenatal screens included blood type A positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative and group B strep unknown.
Pregnancy was notable for monochorionic-diamniotic twin gestation with early ultrasound showing mildly discordant growth.
However, subsequent ultrasounds showed resolution of growth discrepancy and concordant growth thereafter.
Fetal surveys were otherwise unremarkable.
The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and cervical shortening noted around 26 weeks, prompting a course of betamethaone.
Mother experienced intermittent preterm contractions since that time and presented on the day of admission with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Given twin gestation, mother was taken for cesarean section delivery.
Family and social history is notable for father with a limb abnormality and a history of cystic fibrosis in the father's family.
Mother is of [**Name (NI) 70080**]
origin.
At delivery twin #I emerged vigorous with Apgars of 9 and 9. 
Infant was brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for prematurity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Notable for weight of 1680 grams or 75th percentile, length of 42 cm, 50th to 75th percentile and head circumference of 29.5 cm, 75th percentile.
Infant was pink and active in no significant distress.
Features were nondysmorphic.
Red reflex was present bilaterally.
Palate was intact.
Neck was supple.
Lungs were clear with mild intermittent retractions.
Cardiac was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
Abdomen was soft without masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Anus was patent.
Genitalia was that of normal preterm female.
Hips and back were normal. 
Extremities were warm and well perfused.
Tone and activity were appropriate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Respiratory: Infant initially exhibited minimal     respiratory insufficiency and was maintained in room air     for the first several days of life.
Over the first 2 to 3     weeks of life infant did require intermittent treatment     with nasal cannula and CPAP therapy for mild respiratory     distress and frequent apnea spells.
The infant never     required significant oxygen and was maintained on CPAP     for a total of 9 days.
The infant was weaned to room air     alone by day of life 20 and has remained in room air     since that time.
Moderate apnea of prematurity was noted     treated with caffeine.
Caffeine was discontinued at     approximately 34 weeks corrected gestational age.
Since     that time intermittent spells have been noted, with slow     resolution.  
By the time of discharge, the infant has been     without spells for 5 days.
2.  Cardiovascular: The infant has remained hemodynamically     stable since birth without need for cardiovascular     support.
An intermittent murmur was heard although no     other signs of a patent ductus arteriosus were noted.     
Over the last several weeks of hospitalization the murmur     became more persistent and evaluation was performed on     
[**1-15**] to [**1-16**] including a chest x-ray, 4     extremity blood pressures and an electrocardiogram, all     of which
were within normal limits.
Cardiology was consulted     on
[**2193-1-25**], and thought the murmur was consistent with a     flow murmur
; routine monitoring by pediatrician was     recommended.
3.  Fluids and nutrition: The infant was initially maintained     on IV fluids with introduction of enteral feeds on day of     life 2.
Enteral feeds were advanced without difficulty to     full volume and eventually 28 calories per ounce.
Infant     was fed primarily breast milk supplemented with     additional calories as well as some Similac Special Care     formula.
On day of life 26,
[**2192-12-31**],
the infant     was noted to have grossly bloody stools.
Infant was     otherwise well appearing and evaluation including CBC,     blood culture and KUB were reassuring.
The infant was     monitored for 48 hours off of enteral feeds and     examination remained reassuring.
Enteral feedings were     restarted after 48 hours, but using nutramigen.     
Feedings were then advanced to maximum caloric density of     Nutramigen 24 calories per ounce without difficulty.     
Since that time the infant has tolerated feedings well     without evidence of abdominal distention or significant     aspirates.
Stools have remained intermittently heme     positive although otherwise normal in appearance.
The     infant was initially fed via gavage feedings and     gradually transitioned to oral feedings as tolerated.
By     the time of discharge the infant has been feeding all     p.o.
for over 2 weeks with intake of 150 to 200 ml per     kilogram per day and with steady weight gain.
The infant     was maintained on multivitamins during hospitalization     but will not be discharged on these as the infant will be     receiving primarily formula.
In the future if the infant     remains well appearing a transition back to breast milk     from Nutramigen can be considered.
Weight at the time of     discharge was 3065 gm.
4.  Gastrointestinal: Infant did experience mild     hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity requiring phototherapy     for 48 hours.
The maximum bilirubin level was 9.0/0.4 on     day of life 3.
As described above, the infant also     experienced presumed allergic colitis or protein     intolerance.
5.  Heme: The infant was noted to develop anemia of     prematurity requiring a blood transfusion on day of life     17 for hematocrit of 26.
The infant was maintained on     iron and hematocrit following transfusion was 33.     
Hematocrit was noted to gradually decline since that     time, with the last hematocrit on
[**1-17**]
of 24.7     with a reticulocyte count of 2.4.
Repeat hematocrit on     
[**2193-1-21**]
was 23.2 with retic 2.7.  
Given this anemia     iron dose was increased to 4 mg per kilograms per day;     hematocrit will need to be monitored as an outpatient.
6.  Infectious disease: Infant underwent a sepsis evaluation     at birth with an unremarkable CBC and a negative blood     culture.
The infant was treated with ampicillin and     gentamicin for 48 hours at that time.
On day of life 7 to     8 repeat sepsis evaluation was performed due to frequent     spells.
Blood culture eventually grew staph streptococcus-     non-aureus species.
Infant was treated for 1 week with     vancomycin and gentamicin.
A lumbar puncture was     performed and was unremarkable.
As described above a repeat     sepsis evaluation was performed on day of life 26 due to     bloody stools; blood cultures were negative and infant     was treated with 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin.     
No other infectious disease issues have been noted.
7.  
Neurology: Infant has maintained an appropriate     neurologic examination throughout admission.
Head     ultrasound was performed on 1 week of age and again at 1     month of age and both of these were within normal limits.
8.  Sensory: Ophthalmology examination was performed for     screening for retinopathy of prematurity, revealing     initially immature retinas and then mature retinas without     evidence of ROP.  
Examination at 9 months of age is     recommended.  
Hearing screen was performed and passed     bilaterally.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Home.

His initial presention was in late [**2173**]
with hip pain from bone mets, and has been tried on pamidronate/lupron, bicalutamide, ketoconazole and ydrocortisone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and most recently zometa/lupron q12wk and samarium (
[**12-4**], [**12-12**]).  
He has chronic pain between his shoulder blades, on his lateral ribs, and his right pelvis/hip for which he requires chronic narcotic pain medications.  
He feels that the Samarium has helped to relieve his pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8214**]
is a 50y/o gentleman with end-stage castrate-resistant prostate cancer refractory to treatment who was admitted from clinic with saddle hemianesthesia, intermittent urinary retention, and radicular pain with strain that were concerning for cord compression/cauda equina syndrome.  
MRI showed evidence of cord compression; Neurosurgery was been consulted and he underwent T4 laminectomy and T1-
7 fusion. .
ACTIVE ISSUES:
. 
#.
Cord compression: MRI showed new lesion at T4 and mild canal compromise at T10, which was causing spinal canal stenosis and foraminal stenosis. 
Mr. [**Known lastname 8214**]
has known spine mets that are more extensive on bone scan compared to 2 years ago.  
He has not had bowel incontinence, and his urinary retention last week resolved after disimpaction but overall, his saddle hemianesthesia, intermittent urinary retention, and radicular pain with strain were concerning.  
Upon admission, he was started on Dexamethasone 10mg and was continued on 4mg Q6H.
Neuro checks were done Q4H and his neuro status did not change.  
He was transferred to Neurosurgery on
[**12-27**].
Pt underwent T4 laminectomy with T1-T7 fusion.
He tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the ICU for continued care.
He did require multiple blood transfusions to keep his HCT greater than 25.
He extubated without difficulty on
[**12-28**].
His surgical site pain was somewhat difficult to control and he was started on a dilaudid PCA on
[**12-28**] with good result.
He was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
On
[**12-29**]
he JP drain was removed and a simple stitch was placed.
He was mobilized OOB and had upright x rays that showed good placement of surgical hardware.
He was seen by the pain managment team and his Oxycontin was increased to 120mg TID and he was started on oxycodone 15-
20mg q4 prn pain.
This regimen seemed to help and he was able to come off of the PCA. 
He was able to get OOB to chair on
[**12-29**] and ultimately able to stand for upright x rays.  
he ambulated well with PT and pain was controlled with oral meds.
He will be a candidate for radiation therapy one week after surgery. 
. 
#.
Metastatic Prostate cancer: poor prognosis overall.  
He has extensive bony mets and has not responded well to multiple chemotherapies.  
He does feel symptomatic relief in his pain since the Samarium.  
His current regimen is Zometa/Lupron Q12wk as well as Prednisone 5mg daily.  
He did receive one dose of Lupron in house; his Prednisone was held in the setting of Dexamethasone use.  
He continued his home pain control regimen (Fentanyl patch, Oxycontin, Oxycodone).  
He will follow up with his Oncologist. . 
#.
Chronic constipation: in the setting of chronic opiate medication use.  
Required hospitalization recently but since then he has been moving his bowels daily, though stools are loose.  
He was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen (senna, colace, miralax, lactulose) and had no issues with constipation or excessive loose stools. 
. 
#.
Anemia: normocytic.
Baseline Hct seems to be ~36 but now it is 30.8.  
Is on chemo and this could cause bone marrow suppression.  
In addition, he is chronically ill and likely has anemia of inflammation.  
He was guaiac negative and has been constipated, so GI loss is possible but less likely.  
His iron studies do not suggest iron deficiency; his anemia is most likely due to recent chemo/samarium.  
His Hct was trended daily and was stable. 
. 
#.
Tobacco use: he was actively smoking until hospitalization at St.
[**Doctor Last Name 11042**]. 
He was continued on nicotine patch. .

CATH Study
BRIEF HISTORY:
52 yo woman with a long well-documented history of peripheral arterial disease, s/p many percuateneous interventional procedures on her right lower extremity including, most recently, directed thrombolytic therapy and throbectomy for an occluded recent bypass graft to her RLE.
She now returns to the lab with probable re-occlusion of her graft.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Limb threatening peripharal arterial disease
PTCA COMMENTS:
Initial angiography demonstrated a total occlusion of the SFA at just proximal to the proximal graft anastamosis. 
Heparin was started prophylactically.
A stiff angled Glidewire was advanced though the native SFA into the distal popliteal artery were angiography
demonstrated the AT and PT to be totally occluded and the peroneal artery to be patent as the main blood suppy to the foot but with
moderate diffuse disease.
The Glide wire was exchanged for a Mircale Bros 6 wire and atherectomy of the distal SFA into the distal politeal artey was performed.
A wire was passed into the AT and distal injection confirmed that there was no distal runoff via the AT and flow did not improve with atherectomy of the origin of the AT.
We were unable to cross in to the PT with a wire.
We then turned our attention to the peroneal artery where atherectomy was performed on the proximal and mid vessel with restoration of flow into a large distal collateral, however the PT never filled.
A distuption was noted in the mid peroneal artery at this point with diminished flow into the distal artery.
In spite of thrombectomy with an Excisor catheter and several balloon inflations with 2.0 mm balloons.
The case was terminated due to excess flouro time and contrast load.
Final angiography revealed no significant impprovement in blood flow to the foot.
COMMENTS:
1.
Arterial access was obtained in retrograde fashion via the LFA with a 6 French short sheath.
2.
Selective angiography of the right lower extremity revealed the SFA to be totally occluded just proximal to the anatamosis of the graft.
3.
Failed percutaneous intervention on the right lower extremity.
Final angiography revealed no restoration of flow into the infrapapliteal vessels (see PTA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.
Total occlusion of the right SFA.
2.
Failed intervention on the right SFA and infrapopliteal vessels.

PICC W/O PORT
[**Hospital 93**]
MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with R SFA-AT bypass with L arm v. Graft reexploration and thrombectomy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place a midline in RUE.
Unable to get PIV on floor. 
Unable to get midline on floor.
We want to d/c her R IJ.
HISTORY:
Status post right SFA-AT bypass with graft reexploration and thrombectomy.
Needs IV access.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.
The basilic vein was patent and compressible.
After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.
A 0.018 nitinol guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
It was determined that a length of 37 cm would be suitable.
The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance in the superior vena cava.
The sheath was removed.
The catheter was flushed.
Final chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating the tip to be in the superior vena cava.
The line is ready for use.
A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was heplocked.
IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of 37 cm long right basilic single lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava.
The line is ready for use

and you may shower with them on.
If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower.
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery.
MEDICATIONS:
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery.
You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
(Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.)
If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet.
You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia.
Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time.
Eat small balanced meals throughout the day.
CAUTIONS:
NO SMOKING!
We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery.
Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation.
If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible.
Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation.
Avoid  pressure to your amputation site.
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.
DIET:
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred.
For people with
[**Location (un) 1106**]
problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet:
Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood.
Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol.
Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol).
Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended.
You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor.
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight management program.
Your health and its improvement depend on it.
We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude.
If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:
Be sure to keep your medical appointments.
The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have.
Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels.
Don't let them go untreated!
Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit.
This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge.
Normal office hours are 8:30-
5:30 Monday through Friday.

4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-
21**]+) central aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of endocarditis.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. 
. 
[**1-1**]
CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable chest radiograph with no evidence of infiltrates or effusions. 
. 
[**1-4**]
Humerus/Femur Plain Films:
LEFT HUMERUS:
There is a displaced and mildly comminuted distal periprosthetic fracture of the humerus.
A previous a left proximal humerus arthroplasty is well positioned.
There is diffuse osteopenia.
LEFT FEMUR:
There is little change from
[**12-6**]
of the supracondylar distal femur fracture with associated callus formation.
In addition, three displaced femoral neck fracture appears unchanged though is incompletely evaluated on this femur study and is limited by osteopenia and body habitus.
IMPRESSION:
New periprosthetic humerus fracture.
I confirmed that the housestaff were aware of these findings.
Brief Hospital Course:
69F w/ESRD, recent sepsis of UNK source, presenting with fever and sepsis. .
1.
Sepsis: This is a patient who has had multiple past admissions for sepsis.  
Possible etiology included lines, urine, wounds, pneumonia, etc.  
This was considered most likely to be urosepsis, likely secondary to poor hygeine given that the patient is incontinent of stool and likely her infection resulted from GI pathogens entering the urine.  
Wounds and osteomyelitis were also considered as possibilities, but her surgical wound from past ortho procedure was clean and did not appear infected.  
A new PICC line was placed and her initial femoral line was removed.  
Blood cultures from an outside facility grew enterobacter and klebsiella.  
Urine culture here at
[**Hospital1 18**]
grew klebsiella and pseudomonas.  
Initially, the patient was covered broadly with cefipime, linezolid, and flagyl.  
Once sensitivities became available, antibiotics were changed to cefipime/gent.  
A TEE was negative for vegetations. 
Subsequent blood cultures were all negative, and repeat urine cultures were also negative.  
Antihypertensives were held in the setting of sepsis and were not resumed due to low-normal BP. 
Stress dose steroids were started on admission and stopped on 
[**1-2**].  The possibility of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
-vesicular fistula was raised as a possible explanation of recurrent urosepsis.  
The patient had a CT abdomen on a recent previous admission that showed no evidence of such a fistula, so repeat imaging was not done. 
Plan is for cefipime and gentamicin to be continued for 10 more days to complete a 2 week course of both. .
2. ESRD: Renal followed throughout hospital course.  
Patient had HD M-W-F.  Phos binders were held due to low phos.  
Can consider restarting if phos increases.  
Patient received epogen with dialysis. .
3.
Altered Mental Status:
Likely this was due to sepsis.  
Mental status returned to baseline. .
4.
Fractures: Orthopedics evaluated the patient while hospitalized, and repeat films of the humerus and femur were obtained.  
The patient is not an operative candidate at this time, so fractures have been managed non-operatively with pain control.
LUE was kept in a sling, non-weight bearing.  
Patient is bed-bound. .
5. h/o RLL PE (resulting in PEA arrest): Patient is on coumadin at home.  
Coumadin was held for procedures (TEE, etc.) and was restarted prior to discharge.  
She was on a heparin drip while off her coumadin.  
Goal INR is
[**2-22**].  
Patient slightly below goal on day of discharge.  
INR should be checked after discharge and coumadin dose adjusted as needed. .
6.
Htn: Home metoprolol dose was held in the setting of sepsis. 
It was not restarted prior to discharge as her BP remained low-normal without medication.  
BP should be checked after discharge and BB restarted as needed. .
7.
CHF: EF 55% with MR.
HD was continued M-W-F to regulate volume status.  
I/O followed closely. .
8. DM: FS QID, ISS continued.  
Glargine 8U hs continued. .
9.
Skin Breakdown: Secondary to prolonged bed rest, DM2, PVD. 
The patient had consistently dopplerable pulses.
Wound care and nutrition were consulted to make recommendations as well. .
10.
Anemia: BL 29-
33.
No evidence of acute blood loss.

Chief Complaint: Fevers, malaise
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right hepatectomy and small bowel resection of GIST
[**2186-5-18**]
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 year- old male who recently presented with fever and malaise.
A CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated 2 small left upper lobe pulmonary nodules of uncertain etiology but concerning for malignancy.
His abdominal CT demonstrated a left lower quadrant mass that on biopsy was demonstrated to be a GIST tumor that was C-kit positive.
In addition, this CT demonstrated a large mass in the right lobe of the liver that was initially thought to represent an abscess but an attempted CT guided drainage demonstrated only a small amount of blood. 
Biopsies demonstrated only granulation tissue.
The patient had a recent follow-up CT scan that demonstrated rapid and significant enlargement of the right lobe mass.
It was uncertain whether this represented a liver abscess or a tumor with necrosis and secondary infection.
Because of the rapid enlargement of the mass and inability to drain this percutaneously along with continued fevers and malaise, the patient is brought to the operating room after informed consent was obtained for right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and resection of the left lower quadrant GIST tumor.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to the transplant surgical service on 
[**5-18**] with the chief complaint of fevers and malaise.
A CT head and CT abd/pelvis were obtained (see reports above), and he was started on his home medications.
On admission, his temperature was 102.1.
A CXR showed no acute cardio-pulmonary process.
On 
[**5-19**]
, the pt was seen by Thoracic Surgery and had a liver biopsy performed.
He was also seen by GI and ID and nutrition labs were sent.
On
[**5-21**]
, the pt was found to have a positive C.Diff (sent for watery stools).
On [**5-22**]
, the patient was seen by the urology service, and in light of his urological history, he had a Foley placed via cystoscopy during his surgery.
Patient was taken to the OR on
[**5-22**]
for his procedure (see operative note for details).
He was taken to the ICU after his procedure and extubated the same day.
He had a PA line in place, with a CVP from
[**2-11**] and making approx 10-
15cc/hr of urine.
Overnight of POD0, he received 2 Litres in fluid bolus in total for low urine output and SBP in the 80's.
Overnight of POD0, the patient was sleepy and not following commands.
On POD1, the patient remained very sleepy and was not responding to stimuli.
He was then given IV narcan by the ICU team, and was then noted to become more awake.
On
[**5-23**] (POD1)
, he received 2 units of FFP (for an elevated INR) with no correction of INR.
He was then given Vit K SC x 3 days and 1 unit of PRBC.
On
[**5-24**]
, the patient was transfered from the SICU to the floor.
On POD3 (
[**5-25**])
, patient's respiratory saturations were noted to be approx 93%, most likely due to atelectasis.
He was encouraged to use IS.
His diet was advanced from sips to clears.
On
[**5-26**]
, he was noted to have signs of hepatic decompensation with decreased mental status, asterixis, decreased urine output, ascites and increased bilirubin.
He was transfered back to the SICU for closer monitoring.
On
[**5-26**]
, the patient had an ultrasound of the liver to exclude portal vein thrombosis; this was unchanged from the prior study.
On
[**5-28**]
, a PICC was placed for hydration, antibiotics and TPN.
TPN was started the same day.
He was transfered from the SICU back to the floor on this day.
The patient had a voiding trial on
[**5-30**], as reccomended by the urology service.
He was tolerating PO's by
[**5-31**], and received nutritional supplements.
A bedside swallowing evaluation was done on
[**6-1**] during which he presented with mild oral dysphagia and it was determined he could continue with a regular consistency diet with thin liquids.
TPN was stopped on
[**6-3**]. 
The patient's LFT's were found to be elevating from
[**6-3**]
onwards. 
Hence, an ERCP was performed on
[**6-7**].
This showed a normal appearing biliary tree with no evidence of obstruction or a leak.
LFT's continued to rise, and then remained stable on
[**6-8**]. 
On
[**6-8**]
, a suture was removed from the patient's abdomen, but then re-sutured as ascitic fluid leaked from the incision.
On discharge, the patient's total bili had come down; he remained jaundiced but was taking in good amount of PO's (approx
[**2179**] calories)
; he had 2 bowel movements and was ambulating.
His wound was clean, dry and intact, and only required a dry gauze dressing over the area (no packing necessary).
He will require home physical therapy, and he should continue ciprofloxacin for SBO prophylaxis.

Pt reports 2-
3 days of dizziness and "wooziness" during which he has been unable stand w/o feeling that he would fall over.
On the morning of admission pt reports falling twice while trying to get out of bed.
After both falls he was able to pull himself back into bed.
He denies loosing consciousness during either event but does recall hitting his head both times (on his forehead).
Later in the morning he was unable to get out of bed and had to be helped by his
[**Hospital3 12272**]
personnel due to generalized weakness (L>R).
Pt was taken to OSH where CT head demonstrated a moderate sized (~3 cubic cm) IPH into the R posterior parietal lobe w/ SAH extension.
Pt was subsequently transferred to

with subarachnoid extension, without clear identification of a source for the hemorrhage.
See above report for additional findings.
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NSurg ICU for close observation and further work up of this brain hemorrhage.  
A CTA was performed which did not reveal AVM or aneurysm.
He was loaded with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and his SBP was kept below 140.
A neurology consult was obtained to help discern between mass with hemorrhagic conversion, or a true CVA.
On
[**1-2**]
the patient was found to have a focal left arm seizure -
a stat Head CT was performed which showed no change in the size of the hemorrhage.
Keppra was added for increased seizure prophylaxis.
An MRI with and without contrast was obtained on
[**1-4**],
which did not reveal a mass.  
The decision was made to transfer care to the neurology service for further evaluation and management of this hemorrhagic stroke.
He was seen by speech and swallow who determined that he was aspirating fluids and solids, so he was made NPO, and all medications were changed to IV.
He underwent PEG placement.
He developed stridor and respiratory distress while on the floor, for which a code was called and he was intubated and transferred back to the Neuro ICU.
Vocal cords were visualized while in ICU and noted to be edematous, likely from trauma during PEG procedure.
He failed extubation twice; despite attempts with racemic epinephrine and steroids. 
He ultimately required trach.
He had left upper extremity swelling and was found to have a large extensive DVT in left UE, so was started on Coumadin and Lovenox bridge.  
He had a PICC in the left UE which was removed.
He was transferred to step down on the neurology service over the weekend.  
However, on Monday
[**2201-1-19**]
he developed respiratory distress with tachypnea to 40s, desaturation, SBP to 215.
He also spiked a temp to 102 and  had a rising WBC.
ABG was
7.5/35/81.
CXR showed midline trach and no white out.  
Possibly mucus plugging or pneumonia.  
A stat medicine consult was obtained, and he was transferred to the MICU for further management.
Transferred with hypotension, fever, tachypnea and tachycardia, as well as multiorgan dysfunction, from presumed septic shock. 
Blood cultures quickly grew out GNRs.  
Aggresive fluid resuscitation and blood pressure support were continued with multiple pressors.  
Pt was started on antibiotics.  
However organ dysfunction continued, with rising Cr, LFTs, WBC, and apparent DIC.  
RUQ US obtained due to apparent abdominal tenderness; US showed free air.  
Surgery consulted, however pt too unstable to go for CT scan.  
At this point family discussion was held, and patient was made CMO.  
He passed away one hour later.

This is an addendum to the previous discharge summary.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Neurologic:  The patient's neurologic exam did progress slightly to the point that she did have bilaterally spontaneous blinking eyes with some mild oculocephalic reflexes consisting of inferior deviation, mainly of both eyes, more prominent in the right eye than the left.  
There was minimal abduction of the eyes bilaterally to oculocephalic maneuvers.  
She did have gag and cough.  
She was, also, seen to be spontaneously twitching her mouth. 
However, despite the progression in the cranial nerve exam, her mental status essentially remained the same, not responding to any stimulus, including verbal or sternal rub.
2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient is maintained on metoprolol for hypertension, and we allowed the goal of the systolic blood pressure to be less than 160.
3.  Respiratory:  The patient initially was on
the ventilator until
[**2173-2-25**]
, after which she was placed on the trach mask. 
At this time, she is tolerating this well and will probably be observed to insure that the trach is tolerated.  
She did grow out sparse gram negative rods and gram staph aureus coag positive in the sputum, and she was resumed on a new course of oxacillin starting
[**2173-2-24**] for a total of at least seven days.  
Her blood gas on the trach mask was satisfactory.
4.  Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient is still on tube feeds and had received percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy on
[**2-10**].  
In addition, it should be mentioned that the patient, also, received a tracheostomy on that day, 
[**2-10**].
5.  Hematologic:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable and she did not receive any other transfusions since the time of the last dictation.
6.  Infectious disease:  As prior.
7.  
Code status:  The patient is still a full code.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pontine hemorrhage.
2.  Obesity.
3.  Hypertension.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Oxacillin, 2 grams IV q 6 hours for an additional five days.
2.  Heparin, 5,000 units SQ q 12 hours.
3.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
4.  Miconazole powder 2%, one application TP q.i.d.
p.r.n.
5.  Sodium chloride nasal spray, one to two sprays NU t.i.d.

congestion.
6.  Metoprolol, 75 mg PO t.i.d.
7.  Tylenol, 325-
650 mg PO q 4-
6 hours p.r.n.
At the time, the plan for this patient is observation for 24 hours on the trach and she will be discharged on
[**2173-2-26**] to a chronic vent facility where the expectation is that she will continue to wean off the artificial ventilation.

Imaging:
CT
[**2150-2-9**]:
1.
Left basal ganglia hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema.
No new foci of acute hemorrhage.
2.
Hyperdense extra-axial calcified round lesion at the left frontoparietal vertex, which likely represents a meningioma.
Further characterization with MRI is recommended if clinically indicated and if there is no contraindication to use MRI.
CT
[**2149-2-10**]: Again noted is a small focus of acute hemorrhage within the left thalamus.
It currently measures 18 x 16 mm which is essentially unchanged in size from prior keeping in account differences in technique.
There is mild-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema, unchanged.
Though these are likely to be related to hypertension, underlying lesion cannot be excluded Again noted is a right maxillary mucous retention cyst and basilar and bilateral middle cerebral artery calcifications.
There is an unchanged left frontoparietal (near the vertex) ossified lesion, likely representing an ossified meningioma.
There are multiple periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodense foci noted likely related to sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease. 
Atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted. 
The paranasal air sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of small focus of acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus with some surrounding edema.
Though this is likely to be related to hypertension, underlying lesion cannot be excluded. 
MR can be considered, if clinically indicated, after resolution of the hemorrhage.
CXR
[**2150-2-9**]: No previous images.
The heart is substantially enlarged and there is haziness at both bases consistent with some pleural fluid. 
There is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
The dichotomy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or right pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.
[**Known lastname **]
was admitted to neuro ICU for evaluation and treatment of stroke.
She was transfered from OSH with speech difficulty , right hemiplegia  and facial droop and CT head demonstrating a left basal ganglia bleed- 1.9 x 1.8 cm.
She was on coumadin with INR 2 and her blood pressure was 230/110 at OSH.
Prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**]
she was reversed with FFP, and vitamin K 10 mg and several doses of labetalol for blood pressure control.
She was transfered out of ICU on
[**2150-2-11**] on
stroke neurology floor for further care.
Neuro She was closely monitored for neurological signs and improvement.
She was noted to have non fluent aphasia with nearly intact comprehension, with right hemiplegia and facial droop.
She underwent CT scan which showed left basal ganglia bleed with some edema.
She was monitored closely for signs of raised ICP which she did not develop.
She was evaluated by PT/OT/Speech therapy for assesment of function and rehab. 
We stopped her coumadin and aspirin for 3 days after bleed.
She has been started on aspirin 81 mg on
[**2150-2-12**].
we will hold coumadin for 2 weeks after bleed.
She should have repeat CT scan which should be reviewed by her doctor and then decision for starting couamdin should be made.
Cards 
She was in afib with controlled ventricular rate.
She was ruled out for myocardial ischemia with EKG and cardiac enzymes.
TSH was 3.8 to exclude underlying hyperthyroidism .
Her blood pressure was high 190-
200 sysolic and was on labetalol drip for blood pressure control initially which was later stopped.
She was on carvedilol and metoprolol.
We decided to stop carvedilol and continue on metoprolol in increased dose.
Her blood pressure was closely monitored and controlled less than 140 systolic. 
This should be followed closely and controlled to less than 140 systolic.
ID She was noted have U/A suggestive of UTI.
She was started on cipro empirically.
Cultures grew enterococci with sensitivities pending at this point.
This should be followed and antibiotic regime should be chosen appropriately.
General care Initially for first 48 hours we held on SC heparin for DVT proph.
Then it was started.
Chest xray did not reveal any pna. 
she was advised about smoking cessation.
Issues pending at discharge Repeat urine cultures as initial culture could be a contaminent HbA1C and lipid profile for risk factor assesment
Neuro exam at DC has some difficulty in getting words out- non fluent aphasia, comprehension largely preserved, right hemiplegia and facial droop on right side.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Transferred from outside hospital for management of SVC syndrome.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was a 66 year old female with a 50 pack year smoking history who presented with six weeks of facial swelling.  
The patient presented to the outside hospital on
[**2196-11-14**] with one month of facial swelling, shortness of breath with minimal exertion and blood-tinged sputum.  
The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan at the outside hospital which reportedly showed an extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**]
for tissue diagnosis. 
On
[**2196-11-17**]
, a bronchoscopy showed abnormal mucosa in the bronchus intermedius, however, biopsies were nondiagnostic for malignancy.  
A mediastinoscopy was then done which revealed a firm lymph node mass directly inferior to the innominate vein in the pretracheal and right paratracheal region.  
Biopsy of the mass was consistent with nonsmall cell cancer and later reported as large cell lung carcinoma.  
After biopsy, significant bleeding was seen and this incision site was packed with Surgicel.  
Bleeding ceased but the patient was kept intubated for airway protection.  
A repeat bronchoscopy showed narrowing of the trachea to 8 mm. 
No report of the bronchoscopy was sent with the hospital discharge summary from
[**Hospital3 **]
, therefore it is unclear where this narrowing was visualized.  
Radiology Oncology was consulted at an outside hospital and plan was for radiation to begin on
[**11-19**].  
However, because of the patient's intubated state it was felt that the patient could not be transported safely to and from the hospital.  
She was started on Solu-Medrol intravenously and transferred to

HOSPITAL COURSE:
In summary this is a 66 year old female with newly diagnosed large cell lung carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome and airway obstruction who came to [**Hospital6 1760**]
intubated.
Pulmonary -
Large cell lung carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome and airway obstruction.  
During this hospitalization, the patient remained intubated until hospital day #12.  
Until hospital day #10 the patient was noted not to have any air leak and it was thought that she had extrinsic compression of her trachea by her diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  
The patient had a computerized tomography scan of the trachea on
[**11-28**]
after eight to nine doses of radiation which showed trachea that was patent with improvement in its caliber and less extrinsic compression seen on previous computerized tomography scan. 
There was also continued evidence of soft tissue enhancement of the trachea extending to the level of the right main stem bronchus.  
There were also multifocal areas of air space opacities improved in some areas but worse in other areas suggestive of multifocal aspiration or pneumonia and there was also SVC obstruction.  
After it was established that the patient had a significant air leak, she had a bronchoscopy done by Interventional Pulmonology which showed extrinsic compression of the right middle lobe bronchus, however, significant air movement was seen in the right middle lobe bronchus and it was felt that the patient could be safely extubated without need of stent in the right middle lobe bronchus.  
There was also noted to be copious secretions consistent with a post obstructive pneumonia.  
The patient was extubated on hospital day #12 without complications.  
She required frequent suctioning due to secretions and required both nasal cannula and high flow oxygen to maintain a saturation above 90%.  
It was thought that the patient had an element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her smoking history and wheezing on examination.  
She was started on Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers which were
[**2-13**]
and then spread out to prn by hospital day #16.  
In terms of her right middle lobe collapse, due to extrinsic compression and marked middle lobe bronchus it was thought that the patient should be carefully observed, however, stent was not needed at this time.  
It was also thought, that due to the patient's habitus and paradoxical breathing pattern with sleeping that the patient most likely had an element of sleep apnea.  
The patient was started on CPAP trials, however, she did not tolerate the mask and has only been able to tolerate at maximum two hours of CPAP at a setting of 8 cm.  
We will continue to try CPAP mask during the day if the patient can tolerate.  
It was also noted that the patient had a persistent elevated right hemidiaphragm on serial chest x-rays.  
It was thought that due to the patient's cancer and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, that she most likely had paralysis of the right phrenic nerve.  
Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 44983**]
from the Department of Anesthesia evaluated the patient's diaphragmatic movement with ultrasound at the bedside. 
Minimal right diaphragmatic movement was seen.  
The patient also had vital capacities done both supine and sitting up. 
The patient's vital capacity decreased 50% in the supine position.  
The patient was kept in the upright position at all times to maximize vital capacity.  
In terms of the patient's post obstructive pneumonia, the patient has been on a course of Levaquin and Clindamycin.  
At the time of this dictation she is day #12 out of a set course of 21 days.  
By x-ray, chest computerized tomography scan, it appears that the patient may be suffering from aspiration as well.  
The patient does not currently have a gag reflex, and a speech and swallow study is pending at this time.  
She has been kept strict NPO.  
The patient's mental status appears to be approaching baseline and it is not thought that the patient has lost her gag due to decreased mental status or medication effect.  
There may be involvement of tumor and loss of her gag reflex.
On head computerized tomography scan no metastatic disease was found, however, the patient had significant sinusitis involving both maxillary sinuses.  
The patient should continue Levaquin for a 21 day course.  
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued which should improve drainage of her secretions.
Delta Multiple sclerosis -
It was noted that post extubation the patient had confusion and delirium.  
It was thought that this is most likely due to medication effect as she required doses of Ativan for radiation.  
It was thought at this time that since her mental status continued to improve, no other source of delirium was likely.
Oncology -
The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan which showed a right middle lobe dominant lesion of approximately 2 cm.  
Given the lymph node biopsy of large cell, carcinoma was thought most likely that the patient's primary tumor is large cell lung carcinoma.  
She has received ten doses of radiation which the patient has tolerated well and has shown some improvement of tumor size.  
Medical Oncology is currently following and is deciding on a course of chemotherapy, once the patient's respiratory status becomes more stable.
Hypernatremia -
The patient had significant hypernatremia during this admission with sodiums of up to 148.  
The patient has started on free water infusions and this has subsequently improved.
Diabetes -
The patient was on Solu-Medrol for a short period of time, however, since this was not thought to be lymphoma, Solu-Medrol was subsequently discontinued.  
However, while she was on Solu-Medrol the patient required an insulin drip. 
The patient is currently on an insulin sliding scale, however, is receiving dextrose in her partial parenteral nutrition and is started on NPH 4 mg b.i.d.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition -
The patient no longer has an nasogastric tube and is pending a speech and swallow evaluation.  
She is started on partial parenteral nutrition since her PICC line is not central enough for total parenteral nutrition at this time.  
After speech and swallow, if she aspirates during her speech and swallow examination, then the decision whether to pursue a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube will be approached with the patient at that time.
Cardiac -
Given that the patient has an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray and some evidence of interstitial edema an echocardiogram was obtained.  
This showed global HK with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.  
The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease.  
Because of the patient's SVC syndrome, diuresis was not pursued at this time, however, once hypernatremia resolves, the patient may benefit from diuresis in the future.  
No further cardiac workup has been pursued.
Tubes, lines and drains -
The patient has a PICC line, day #8 at this time of this dictation
and she has a Foley catheter.
Urinary tract infection -
The patient had a Klebsiella urinary tract infection during this hospitalization which has been pansensitive to antibiotics.
Code Status -
The patient is currently full code, however, will set up meeting with family and patient within the next several days to readdress this issue.
Prophylaxis -
The patient is on heparin subcutaneous and Protonix.
DISPOSITION: Currently in the Fenard Intensive Care Unit.

All other subsequent blood cultures -
negative .
RADIOLOGY: .
CTA Chest (
[**8-14**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.
Bilateral upper lobe consolidations and ground-glass opacities along the bronchovascular trees.
Differential includes but is not limited to infection, pulmonary hemorrhage and drug toxicity.
3.
Sub-5-mm non-calcified lung nodules, not seen on prior study dated
[**7-3**], [**2115**]
, likely infectious in nature.
However, in view of patient's history of lymphoma, a repeat study after appropriate treatment is recommended to document resolution.
4.
Incidentally noted, bilateral maxillary sinus air-fluid levels.
5.
Hiatal hernia. .
CT Mandible/Sinus (
[**8-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.
Extensive paranasal disease with interval worsening in the left maxillary sinus and left ostiomeatal unit.
High density material in the right maxillary sinus is again seen and can be due to fungal or chronic inflammatory etiology or inspissated secretions.
Superimposed aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary and ethmoid air cells indicate acute component and are new.
2.
Extensive periodontal disease, partially imaged.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr
[**Known lastname 1001**]
is a 54-year old man with a past medical history of non-Hodgkins lymphoma status post allo SCT in
[**10/2114**], recent history of MRSA and Pseudomonas sinusitis as well as Pseudomonas pneumonia who was admitted from clinic on
[**2115-8-14**]
to ICU for shortness of breath, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates occuring in the setting of magnesium infusion. 
. 
#.
Acute cardiopulmonary episode -
On initial presentation, pt with acute SOB, crackles, rigors, hypertension, and tachycardia. 
Differential included PE, MI, anaphylactic reaction, line infection, or pulmonary flash.
In the ICU, he was found to have multilobar consolidations (and absent PE) on CXR and CT, and empiric treamtent for pneumonia was begun with vancomycin and meropenem.
He had a recurrent episode of tachycardia, hypertension, and chills/rigors after the Hickman was used on 
[**8-15**] overnight.
With this evidence and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella, his right subclavian Hickman was removed on 
[**8-16**].
Discharged on Ciprofloxacin. 
. 
#.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
CT scan on
[**2115-5-8**]
continued to show response to his transplant.
There is a long-term plan to repeat CT scans of the torso and sinus CT on
[**2115-8-28**]
after he completes his antibiotics for his pneumonia.
Continued post-transplant prophylaxis. 
. 
#.
GVHD, chronic extensive.
(As per
[**Hospital 3242**] clinic note). Mr. [**Known lastname 1001**] 
has had a persistent rash, thought at first to be related to a drug rash, but now biopsy-proven GVHD.
His PUVA therapy remains on hold.
His liver enzymes are markedly improved.
He will decrease his prednisone to 15 mg and continues on started Entocort.
He remains on a low dose of Neoral.
His skin is darker in tone but with some lighter areas and his rash overall is improved.
He has hypopigmented areas.
He will continue to use Clobetasol ointment on his hands every other night with gloves. 
. 
#.
Hypertension.
Continued outpatient regimen . 
#.
Steroid induced diabetes.
Stable on the Glipizide.
While his prednisone is tapered we will need to keep a closer eye on his blood sugars.

CXR:Comparison demonstrates that the multiple linear atelectasis and local right- sided pleural thickening is related to the most recent mitral valve replacement.
A linear left lower lobe posterior segment atelectasis that is present now was not found on the preoperative examination.
There is, however, no evidence of any significant CHF, nor are there any new parenchymal infiltrates identified.
Brief Hospital Course:
Pre-operative:
CHF:
symptoms may be worsening, perhaps
[**1-20**]
Mitral failing valve.
LV systolic diameter abnormal, necessitating valve replacement before permanent damage ensues.  
She was continued on her lasix/ACEI and remained clinically euvolemic.  
Valve replacement as below.
MV:
Cardiac surgery was consulted for consideration of replacement of the mitral valve.  
She underwent pre-operative workup, including UA, CXR, CT of the head, and carotid US.  
All were normal.  
CT of the head showed evidence of old stroke.  
She was taken for surgery on
[**2146-7-19**].
PVD:
Vascular surgery was consulted for input on her Left lower extremity non-healing ulcer.  
They felt that it was not infected and recommended continued wet to dry dressing changes.  
It was not felt that this would be a contraindication to surgery.
IVDU:
Methadone and percocet were continued in-house as per her outpatient regimen.
CVA:
she sustained a stroke during aortic valve surgery and has been on tegretol since that time for seizure prophylaxis.  
This was continued in-house.
Disposition:
She was taken for Mitral valve replacement on 
[**2146-7-19**] and transferred to the cardiac surgery service at this time.
Taken to the operating room on

mechanical) via right thoracotomy with rib removal.  
Post-op, she was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable condition, on Epinephrine and neosynephrine gtts.  
Sedation and vasopressors were weaned off, but she was slow to wake.  
On POD # 2, the neurology service was consulted due to continued decreased responsiveness.  
EEG at that time did show some seizure activity, and tegretol was subsequently increased.  
MRI showed multiple
[**Last Name (un) **]
appearing infarcts, with no acute lesions.  
She began to awaken over the next few days, had remained hemodynamically stable, and was ultimately transferred to the post-op telemetry floor on POD #
5.  Anticoagulation was started with heparin, and transitioned to Coumadin as her INR increased. 
A wound care consult was obtained for her foot ulcer, and Silvadene dressings were recommended.  
Physical  therapy was begun, but the patient is slow to progress with ambulation and stability.  
Her Methadone dose had been decreased during her post-operative course (from her pre-op dose of 30 mg daily) to 10 mg daily due to her decreased mental status and overall sedation.  
She has remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready for discharge to rehab for physical therapy and progression to independent ambulation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 53-year-old male Ethiopian with history of intracerebral hemorrhage most likely from hypertension in the cerebellar region near the fourth ventricle one month ago,
[**2103-6-19**], that presents with decreased energy and emesis times one week at rehab.  
The patient currently in rehab and was here in the Emergency Department one day prior to admission and diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with Levaquin.  
CT of the abdomen showed gallstone but no other pathology.  
The patient states he vomits up everything he eats including medications. 
It is green
and he occasionally has blood.  
He complains of dizziness that feels like the room is spinning.  
The patient worsens after food intake.  
No fever or upper respiratory infection.  
No diarrhea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Back pain status post fall with back and neck injuries
[**2103-5-10**]; status post cerebellar hemorrhage
[**2103-6-19**]
; status post ventricular drain; hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:
Reglan 25 b.i.d.
, Levaquin 500 q. day, citalopram 20 q. day, Megace 40 b.i.d., milk of magnesia, bisacodyl, captopril 75 t.i.d., nicardipine 20 q. 8h., metoprolol 75 b.i.d., heparin 5000 subcutaneous b.i.d., Tylenol q. 6h., Percocet q. 6h.
as needed.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Worked as
[**Doctor Last Name **]
at the airport but has been in rehab for a month.  
No alcohol, no tobacco personally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Two brothers had cholecystic disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
98.8, 164/110, 84, 18, 98 percent on room air.  
No apparent distress.  
Alert and oriented times three.  
Cachectic appearing.  
Moist mucus membranes. 
Oropharynx moist.  
Regular rate without murmur.  
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
Soft, diffusely tender, no guarding, no rigidity, faint bowel sounds.  
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  
Warm.  
Dorsalis pedis's 2 plus.
RADIOLOGY:
CT of the abdomen and kidneys showed gallstone, mild ascending colon dilation.
LABORATORY:
Urinalysis was completely normal.  
No signs of infection.  
White count 4.6, hematocrit 37.3, platelet count 374,000.  
Electrolytes were unremarkable.  
Liver function tests were within normal limits except for an alk phos of
134.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Nausea and emesis:  Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted.  
It was felt that the nausea and emesis were due to irritation of the edema and blood that stills surrounds the fourth ventricle which is near the chemotactic area.  
The patient had a repeat MRI and CT scan which showed no further hydrocephalus.  
The patient was transferred for one day to the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit for a ventricular drainage which showed an opening pressure of 13-
14 cm which was within normal limits.  
They also drained some fluid with only modest improvement in nausea and dizziness.  
The patient slowly recovered.  
He was treated with ondansetron and Ativan to try to alleviate the nausea.  
He has been slowly improving his oral intake and is taking nectar, thick liquids and soft solids.  
Each day the patient seems to have modest improvements.  
Neurology also wanted the patient to be on glycerine one ounce four times a day to try to decrease the swelling surrounding that fourth ventricle which is near the chemotactic area.
Hypertension:
The patient has very difficult hypertension to manage.  
He is currently taking atenolol and captopril.  
He may need increases in these doses with goal systolic blood pressures around 140.
Vertigo:
The patient has sort of difficulty tracking things with his eye movements.  
The neurologist felt that this was not vertigo, however, and that is all related to the intracerebellar hemorrhage.
Urinary tract infection:  There were no signs of UTI in the old UA or the new one so the Levaquin was discontinued.
DISPOSITION:
The rest of this discharge summary will be dictated when the patient is discharged.

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-7-3**]
TTE Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-
45%) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal-mid infero-lateral wall and akinesis of the basal-mid inferior wall. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. ?
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:
poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Mild regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
The right ventricle is not well seen.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112268**]
was a same day admit and on
[**6-28**]
he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see operative note for surgical details.
He arrived from unit intubated on Levophed.
He weaned and extubated without difficulty.
Pressor was weaned off, he started on low dose Lopressor and Lasix.
Permanent pacemaker reprogrammed.
On POD#2 he became SOB/wheezy with low sats, thick secretions that were difficult to raise.
His ABG revealed p02 of 49.
He received aggressive pulmonary toileting,mucinex and required high flow fio2.
CXR appeared wet and he was started on a Lasix gtt and was aggressively diuresed.
He responded well to treatment and over the course of the next 24-
48hrs his Fio2 was weaned down.
His Creatinine peaked to 2.1 with diuresis but has since been trending down.
It was 1.4 at the time of discharge.  
On POD#2 he went into rate controlled afib and was started on amiodarone. 
His PPM was noted to be inappropriately sensing and pacing and it was evaluated by the EP department.
His atrial lead was not sensing/pacing properly which was felt to be related to post-op edema.
He was diuresed and PPM was reinterrogated on
[**7-4**] by EP service and felt to be pacing appropriately.  
This is to be reinterrogated at follow up appointment with cardiologist in 3 weeks.
His epicardial wires were eventually removed without difficulty.
His amiodarone was discontinued 2nd to sinus Bradycardia.
He was started on Coumadin for post-op a-fib.
He became supratherapuetic on
[**7-3**]
with a peak INR of 6.5 and was given Vitamin K and Coumadin was held.
INR was 1.2 at the time of discharge and the patient was instructed to take 1 mg Coumadin on
[**7-5**].
Coumadin dosing will be followed by
Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] and the nurse in the [**Hospital 197**] clinic at Dr[**Name (NI) 11574**] office was contact[**Name (NI)
**] and faxed with recent INR/ Coumadin doses. 
Chest tubes were removed without difficulty.
On POD 6 he transferred to the floor.  
Once on the floor, he continued to progress well.  
He was weaned off oxygen, tolerating a full oral diet and ambulating in the halls without difficulty.
On POD 7, he was cleared by physical therapy for home.
All follow up appointments were made.  
Of note, he needs follow up for LLL calcified node in 6 months.

. 
Pt states that he was in his usual state of health until the morning of
[**12-26**], one day after having unprotected sex with a new female partner, when he developed a severe sore throat that limited his PO intake.
He denies any associated congestion, rhinorrhea, fevers or chills at that time.
Within the next couple of days he developed a cough productive of sputum that was usually white, but intermittently green or red/[**Location (un) 2452

. 
He was found to have multifocal pneumonia on CXR and was treated with Vancomycin, CTX, azithro, levofloxacin, and solumedrol (for concern of retropharyngeal abscess).
There was also initial concern of retropharyngeal abcess but his neck CT was negative for this.
He defervesced on the above antibiotics and 10L fluid resuscitation with imrovement in oxygen requirement from 100% NRB to 4L NC. . 
This morning Pt is feeling much better.
He has a persistent cough, but denies shortness of breath on NC O2.
His sore throat is also improving. .

RADIOLOGY [**12-29**]
CXR PA/LAT:
IMPRESSION:
Bilateral airspace consolidation in the lingula and right upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia. 
. 
[**12-29**]
CXR AP port:
FINDINGS:
Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright with grid" is compared with the study obtained some two hours earlier.
The lung volumes remain low and (allowing for technical differences) the patchy airspace process involving the right mid lung and both lung bases has become more confluent.
There is no pleural effusion and the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged, with no evidence of hilar adenopathy.
Incidentally noted is an apparent 'ostomy tube in the right central abdomen. 
. 
[**12-30**]
CXR AP port: Rapid progression of right lung consolidation involving right lower lobe/anterior right upper lobe.
Left lower lobe process is also progressing, but less extensively. 
. 
[**12-31**]
CXR PA/LAT: Widespread, multifocal areas of consolidation have progressed in the interval, particularly in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.  
Additionally, new patchy ill-defined areas of consolidation have developed within the upper lungs, right greater than left.  
Small left pleural effusion with apparent loculation is also demonstrated, new in the interval. 
. 
[**1-1**]
CXR PA/LAT:
In comparison to the previous radiograph from 
[**2200-12-31**]
, there is further progression of bilateral parenchymal consolidations.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  
The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal, no evidence of pleural effusions. 
. 
[**2201-1-1**]
CT CHEST: MPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia characterized by the presence of consolidation in all lung segments along with some reactive lymphadenopathy and accompaning pleural fluid bilaterally.
Non pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum, most likely reactive.
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
Pt is a 19 yo male with an extensive psychiatric history as well as a history of poly-substance abuse in the past who presents with fever, sore throat and respiratory distress. 
. 
# Multifocal pneumonia:  Initially, due to concern for respiratory distress and fever, Pt was assessed by CT scan for pharyngeal abscess, which was negative.
His initial CXR, however, showed a multifocal pneumonia by CXR.
Pt received Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin in the ED as well as solumedrol and stablized from a respiratory standpoint.
He was admitted to the ICU because of the extent of his initial respiratory distress, but was saturating at or near 100% on RA at that point.
Upon transfer to the floor pt remained febrile, but was saturating in the mid 90s on room air.
Vancomycin was discontinued in the setting of 72 hours of negative blood cultures. . 
With continued fevers, Clindamycin was added given concern for the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
This concern was raised in the setting of a multilobular process combined with the fact that Pt has been taking multiple sedating medications at relatively large doses.
Pt defervesced following the addition of clindamycin with decreased cough and improved SaO2, including the maintanence of SaO2 in the 90's during ambulation on
[**2201-1-2**].
. 
Given risk factors of IVDU and unprotected sex Pt was tested for HIV and both Antibody and viral load were negative.
Influenza a/b DFA was negative.
GAHS throat swab was negative as was urine legionella, GC, and Chlamydia. . 
Pt was discharged in stable condition and was instructed to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for likely community acquired pneumonia. 
. 
# OCD/MDD: Pt did not manifest any signs or symptoms of active OCD or depression during this admission.
He was made aware of the fact that there was concern for the possibility of an aspiration event secondary to over-sedation, but deferred psychiatric consultation on numerous occasions as he prefers to have his medications managed by his outside psychiatrist.
A detailed message regarding Pt's clinical course and concern for the possibility of overmedication was left with Pt's psychiatrist on the day of discharge.
Pt was otherwise maintained on his home doses of psychiatric medications during this hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female admitted to MICU from ED under sepsis protocol. 
Found to be in urosepsis.
1.
[**Name (NI) 15305**]
Pt was septic and entered sepsis protocol.
She was on dopamine for BP support in the MICU overnight and started on vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl.
Initially urine grew GNR, and blood had 2/4 bottles of staph coag negative.
Additionally, CT scan showed ?
minimal diverticulitis and thus all those things were being covered.
The staph was likely contaminant as it grew out four different species.
Additionally, urine grew e. coli pansensitive and pt was started on amoxicillin.
Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl were then d/cd.
Pt was then hemodynamically stable and did well.
2.
[**Name (NI) 3674**]
Pt with Hct that had decreased to 24 on admission, with a normal Hct in low 30s and here with guaiac positive stool, requiring two units of pRBC.
Also appeared to have anemia of chronic disease on iron studies (low iron, low TIBC, high ferritin).
An active T&S was kept at all times as well as 2 large bore IVs.
PPI was changed to
[**Hospital1 **].
Hct after transfusions remained stable.
3.
CV- a. Ischemia- EKG showed inferolateral TWI and ST depressions. 
Cardiac enzymes x 3 were done.
Troponins were up to 0.08 but CKs and MBs flat; this was thought to
[**1-16**]
demand, a low pressure state, and increased HR.
We continued ASA, beta blocker, Statin, and ACE inhibitor.
b. Pump- Echo
[**2141**] with EF 20%.
Pt was euvolemic on exam. 
Initially we held her Lasix as she was auto diuresing and did not take in a lot of PO except for when her husband was present. 
Lasix was restarted on discharge.
Continued beta blocker, ACE as above.
c. Rhythm- Normal sinus.
4.
Metabolic acidosis- Pt had a non gap hypochloremic metabolic acidosis initially.
It was likely [**1-16**]
renal failure as well as normal saline.
This resolved.
5.
ARF- Baseline creatinine 1.6-
2.1, 3.8 on admission.
It was from a prerenal etiology, low blood pressure and decreased forward flow.
This resolved during hospitalization.
6.
DM- Gets 14 units 70/30 at home.
Continued home insulin, slightly decreased as pt was taking poor POs.
She was also on a RISS.
7.
Seizure disorder- Continued valproate per outpatient dosages.
8.
Psych- continued Zyprexa per home dosages.
9.
F/E/N- cardiac low salt diet.
Electrolytes were checked and repleted.
10.
PPx- subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, PPI.
Refused to work with physical therapy.
11.
Code status- Code status was Full Code.
12.
Access- IJ CVL, arterial line while in MICU.
2 PIVs on floor.

Diffusely echogenic kidneys bilaterally, nonspecific, and can be seen with medical renal disease.
2.
Hypoechoic focus in the mid pole of the right kidney, with a thin septation.
While findings could represent a prominent pyramid, septated cyst is also a possibility.
Recommend further evaluation with a renal protocol MRI or CT on a non-emergent basis.

Linear strands of atelectasis at L lung base.
Liver without focal defects or dilated bile ducts.
No hydronephrosis.
Mild perinephric stranding bilaterally.
No bowel obstruction.
Appendix normal.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild vascular engorgement.
Slightly increased opacities in the left upper lobe, could reflect mild edema or may reflect early consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU on
[**10-26**] for new onset acute renal failure (Cr of 12) and CK of 93,000 and with elevated transaminases as well.
Rhabdomyolysis:
Patient initially presented with highly elevated CK and
[**Last Name (un) **].
Etiology of rhabdomyolosis, considered as a sequelae of recent bike accident and concaine use.
The possibility of compartment syndrome was considered, however, physical exam was not c/w this diagnosis.
Also on differential was HIV given his risk factors and erlichiosis given that he is from
[**Location (un) **] (but 
parasite smear at OSH negative and pt does not recall tick bite).
Pt was given aggressive fluid repletion initially with NS and then with 1/2 NS c 1.5 amps bicarb.
Pt's bicarb was followed to ensure that metabolic acidosis was not entirely corrected (as metabolic acidosis is protective for hypocalcemic seizures both by raising seizure threshold and by decreasing the fraction of calcium bound to albumin).
Pt's electrolytes were trended.
Pt was significantly hypocalcemic but without symptoms.
The calcium was not repleted as it was felt that pt would soon become significantly hypercalcemic
[**3-16**] lysis of muscle cells.
CK and uric acid were also trended and they slowly trended down.
IVF were eventually discontinued secondary to pt's poor urine output and increasing volume overload.
HIV and Hepatits serologies were negative.  
Upon transfer to the floor, he continued improve with intermittent HD and fluid support.  
His CK trended down and he did well.
Acute Renal Failure:
Initial differential consists of rhabdomyolysis, DIC, TTP-HUS, severe babesiosis (given
[**Location (un) 7453**] location).
Renal was consulted and felt that this presentation was typical of ATN
[**3-16**] rhabdomyolysis.
DIC labs were negative as was parasite smear.
Pt recieved aggressive fluid hydration as above.
Pt's renal function did not improve over initial several days in MICU, pt was thus started on hemodialysis on HD.  
He improved after 2 rounds of HD and continued to mobilize fluids.  
His creatinine plateaued in the mid-2's, with good urine output.  
He was able to void on his own without any issues.
Acute hepatitis: Patient initially presented with transaminitis with initial differential including rhabdomyolosis (ALT and AST from muscle source rather than liver), hepatitis B/C given polysubstance abuse history, severe babesiosis, acetaminophen toxicity and alcoholic hepatitis (unlikely as tox screen was negative).
Hepatitis B and C serologies were consistent only with prior hepatitis B vaccination.
RUQ u/s was unremarkable for liver process and parasite smear was negative for babesiosis x2 (OSH and here).  
As he improved, his LFT's returned to
[**Location 213**].
Right upper extremity DVT: Pt found to have increased edema in right upper extremity and an ultrasound was done which did show DVT.
Pt was started on heparin gtt (lovenox not an option give 
[**Last Name (un) **]).  
Repeat RUE US prior to discharge showed no clot.
Given resolved clot, and low chance of clot in his baseline medical condition (healthy 34 yom prior to rhabdo), and his new retroperitoneal bleed.  
Heparin gtt was stopped before discharge.
Right flank pain/RP hematoma: Patient had right flank pain that was persistent after arrived on the floor.  
Given his history of trauma and recent anticoagulation due to his RU DVT, retroperitoneal bleed was considered.
CT of abdomen was done to eval for abnormalities and RP bleed was identified.  
Serial HCT was stable, VSS and HD stable.  
He was discharged with follow up instructions to his PCP.
Polysubstance Use/pain:
patient admitted to actively using cocaine, and alcohol.
SW consulted.
Pt complained of severe diffuse muscle pain, more than would be expected for rhabdomyolsis.
Compartment syndrome was considered but pt's extremities remained warm and well perfused with good pulses. 
Also, pt could not localize his pain to any one extremity.
Pt was felt to likely be withdrawing from opioids (pt does report occasional heroin use and ?
other prescription medications).
Pt was initially treated c fentanyl boluses and then transitioned to PO morphine plus MSContin, which were then slowly weaned.
Pt treated with nephrocaps, thiamine, folate.  
He was asymptomatic throughout his stay on the floor and remained so at discharge.
Anemia:
Hct 33.2 on admit with MCV 89.
At OSH, Hct 38.
DIC, hemolysis, TTP were considered, however, other hemolysis and/or DIC labs were negative.
Pt's hematocrits were trended and an active type and screen maintained.  
He remained stable at discharge.
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
this was attributed to uremia in the setting of acute onset renal failure.
Ethanol and ASA screens were negative.
Resolved on the floor.
Hyponatremia:
Given history of nausea and vomiting over 5 days, hyponatremia may be due to hypovolemia and GI losses.
Serial Na's were monitored and stable and IVF resuscitation was continued.  
Resolved on the floor prior to discharge.
Thrombocytopenia:
differential diagnosis included liver disease, splenic sequestration, drug-related, alcohol use, babesiosis and HIV.
HIV and hepatitis serologies were negative.
Platelet counts were trended and stable.
Hypoechogenic Focus R Kidney:
While findings could represent a prominent pyramid, septated cyst is also a possibility. 
Recommend further evaluation with a renal protocol MRI or CT on a non-emergent basis.

Right frontal and temporal hemorrhagic contusions , small right frontal, parafalcine subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages, not significantly changed compared with the study of eleven (11) hours prior.
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.
[**Known lastname 60146**]
was admitted to the TSICU intubated and sedated in stable condition.
She was started on ceftriaxone, vanco, acyclovir for the elevated WBC found on admission to cover for a possible meningitis.
The patient was extubated in the evening of her admission.
She underwent repeat head CTs which were unchanged.
She was transferred to the floor on
[**2192-2-14**]
in restraints and with a 1:1 sitter for agitation and altered mental status.
She continued to receive antibiotics until her her CSF gram stain, culture, HSV, RPR, bacterial antigens returned negative.
She was continued on her home buprenorphine at 2mg
[**Hospital1 **] and was given haldol as needed for agitation.
She also received dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. 
The patient continued to be drowsy and at times agitated and was poorly responsive to our questioning.
This was believed to be part due to her intracranial hemorrhage, her underlying psychiatric disorders, and her drug addiction therapy.
Also, the patient had received significant amounts of sedatives during her initial hospitalization period due to severe agitation. 
She was closely followed by psychiatry and recommendations were made to discontinue the ativan and maintain haldol as needed for agitation, place the patient in a veil bed, and add seroquel and trazodone to her regimen.
This was well tolerated by the patient and her restraints were subsequently removed.
The patient seemed to do better with when her mother was present.
When her mental status improved, the patient was taken out of the veil bed and placed in a regular bed with a sitter.
The sitter was removed after a day of observation and the patient did well and was compliant without supervision.
The patient was discharged home on HD#15 with instructions to continue taking the Dilantin for 2 weeks and follow up at the Neurosurgery and Trauma Clinics.

MEDICAL CONDITION:85 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for aspiration Preliminary Report Swallowing video fluoroscopy: oropharyngeal swallowing video fluoroscopy was Preliminary Reportperformed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
Multiple Preliminary Reportconsistencies of barium were administered. 
Oral and pharyngeal swallow delay were observed.
There was aspiration of thin liquids and penetration with nectar.
Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old male that presented to OSH after awaking from sleep 
[**2-3**]
night with severe cough, nausea, and chest discomfort.
In the emergency room he was treated for rapid atrial fibrillation and with Duonebs, Unasyn, azithromycin, and IV solumedrol due to wheezing.
He ruled in for non st elevation myocardial infarction with troponin 4.01 and was referred for cardiac catheterization. 
He underwent cath on
[**2-7**] which revealed significant coronary artery disease.
He was now transferred for surgical evaluation to
[**Hospital1 18**].  
After preoperative work up was complete, he was brought to the operating room on
[**2-8**]
where the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery.
CROSS-CLAMP
TIME:
69 minutes PUMP TIME:79 minutes.  
See operative note for full details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
He was in a atrial fibrillation/flutter with rates from 60-
120's. 
Lopressor was titrated and he was placed back on his home dose of Digoxin for better rate control.
He had up to 2.6 second pauses in his chronic atrial fibrillation and EP was consulted. 
Digoxin was stopped and Lopressor was titrated.
He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due to his high risk of falls.
He had a chronic Foley in place for a history of neurogenic bladder.
He also had a swallow evaluation postop due to a preoperative history of dysphagia which showed possible aspiarion and he underwent a video study which showed aspiration of thin liquids, penetration of nectar, and he was put on a modified diet.
He had a poor oral intake and was started on supplements.
His po intake improved at the time of discharge. 
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was able to stand at bedside with assistance, but required
[**Doctor Last Name 2598**]
lift to get OOB to chair.
His wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics(Tylenol).
He failed to void after Foley catheter removal and required reinsertion of catheter, of note patient with neurogenic bladder had chronic foley for 5 years prior to surgery.  
The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital 38**] rehab on POD 6 in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

The repaired mitral valve is not well visualized from all angles but the leaflets are no longer flail and coapt better than before.
There is now trace mitral regurgitation without evidence of mitral stenosis (gradient 3 mmHg).
Mild aortic insufficiency remains.
Left ventricular function remains normal.
Normal aortic contours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.
[**Known lastname **]
was admitted post cardiac catheterization for Heparin bridge with plan for surgery on  
[**8-27**].
The cathetreization revealed nonobstructive disease and carotid ultrasound was likewise insignificant.
She underwent the usual pre-operative work-up and on
[**8-27**]
was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent mitral valve repair.
Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. 
Diuresis towards her peroperative weight was instituted and beta blockade resumed.
She was transferred to the floor.
She remained in atrial fibrillation and temporary pacing wires and CTs were removed per protocols.  
Coumadin was resumed witha target INR of [**2-
25**].5.  
She was seen by the Physical therapy service for mobility and strength and ready for discharge on POD
5. Arrangements were made for family to stay with her around the clock and her anticoagulation to be managed as preoperatively by>>>>>

Carotids: Normal study
MRI/MRA:
1.
Acute infarct involving the right frontal and temporal lobes as well as the right insula.
The extent of the infarct matches the size seen on the preceding CTP MTT map.
2.
Corresponding abrupt termination of the anterior superior branch of the right middle cerebral artery consistent with an acute thromboembolism.
3.
Old infarcts of the left frontal and parietal lobes as well as old traumatic encephalomalacia of the inferior frontal lobes bilaterally.
TTE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are simple focal atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta (at 35 mm).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA:
Slight increased density of the cortical region in the infarcted right middle cerebral artery area is due to laminar necrosis.
No large hematoma seen.
Slight increased mass effect is identified due to some increase in edema at the region of right MCA infarct.
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.
[**Known lastname **]
was transferred from an OSH after receiving IV tPA. 
On arrival he had a repeat CTA which showed cut off at M2 and poor volume and decreased MTT in anterior branch of right MCA. 
Based on somewhat distal location, its thought that more invasive treatment such as IA TPA or clot retrieval are not good options.
He was therefore admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.
He was ruled out for an MI with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
He was monitored on tele and found to have paroxysmal afib.
The cardiology service has been following him.
He was maintained euglycemic and normothermic.
His BP was allowed to autoregulate with a goal 140s-160s, sbp<185 and dbp<105. . 
A repeat CT
[**12-5**]
showed some hemorrhagic conversion.
He had a secondary stroke prevention work-up with a FLP (Total/HDL/LDL -
 108/49/49) and A1c (5.9).
A TTE and TEE were negative for intracardic source of thrombus.
Carotid dopplers were also negative. . 
He was treated with aspirin 81mg, zetia and atorvastatin.
Due to the hemorrhagic conversion coumadin initiation had to be discontinued.
He will need to start coumadin 10 days after his hemorragic conversion (
[**12-15**]) and the goal INR will be between 
[**1-31**].
Blood pressure goal is 110-
140 for now;
HR>50.
He is receiving lopressor for rate control and once his bloodpressure allows, he should be started on a small dose of lisinopril (2.5mg).
He was also started on Celexa for mild depression which can be titrated as needed. .

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92920**]
is a 71 year old woman with a history of hypertension and afib, on coumadin, who has complained of headache and neck pain for two days.  
Today at 1 p.m. she was found in her car in a public parking lot, unresponsive.  
In the field her BP was 170/90, HR 92, BG 137.
Intubation was attempted unsuccessfully and she vomited.  
She was bagged until she arrived at
[**Hospital1 **]
at 1:11 p.m.  There she was noted to have reactive pupils, 3>2 mm, but otherwise no movement and no responsiveness on examination.  
Her initial BP was 86/41, HR 80, RR 18.  
She was given etomidate, succinylcholine, and intubated.  
She had intermittent bradycardia to the 40's.  
Head CT revealed a massive intraventricular hemorrhage with subarachnoid blood. 
She had an INR of 3.73.  
She was given dilantin and mannitol IV.  
FFP was ordered but did not arrive before she was transferred to
[**Hospital3 **]
, with arrival at 4 p.m. Hence her anticoagulation was not reversed until 4:05 p.m., when she was given 2 bottles of proplex and 10 mg vitamin K SC.
Neurosurgery was consulted and placement of an EVD was attempted on three occasions, with clotting each time preventing any drainage.  
She again received mannitol, with a dose of decadron as well.  
It was decided that no surgical intervention could be performed and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]
discussed with the family
the gravity of the situation.  
They requested transfer back to
[**Hospital1 **], but
that hospital refused.  
The family expressed that they wanted full medical treatment, and hence the patient was ordered for an ICU bed and Neurology was consulted, 5 hours after her arrival in the ED.
She received Ancef for the attempted EVD placement, and the following sedating medications: versed 4 mg en route to
[**Hospital1 18**] 
(around 4 p.m.); ativan 2 mg at 4:35 p.m.; morphine 10 mg at 4:40 p.m.

IMAGING:
CT/A of Head:
There is a large amount of blood in the right and left lateral ventricles, in the third and fourth ventricles.
The ventricles are pathologically dilated, and there is a ventricular drain entering the right frontal lobe and terminating in the left lateral ventricle.
There is a small amount of parenchymal blood in the left temporal lobe adjacent to the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
There is a linear density in the right sylvian fissure, which in the absence of corresponding vascular abnormalities on the CTA portion of the study must represent subarachnoid blood.
There is a large amount of blood in the suprasellar, quadrigeminal plate, and other basal cisterns, which are compressed.
There is diffuse edema in the brain parenchyma, with bilateral subfalcine herniation, compression of the midbrain and pons, and uncal herniation. 
The imaged bones appear unremarkable.
The patient is intubated and has a nasogastric tube. 
CIRCLE OF
[**Location (un) **]
CTA: The major tributaries of the circle of 
[**Location (un) 431**] are patent without evidence of stenosis.
The left posterior cerebral artery gives off a prominent branch adjacent to the area of left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage, but without evidence of a vascular malformation or aneurysm.
There is fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery.
In the right middle cerebral artery, there is a 2-mm infundibulum at the origin of the temporal polar branch, but no evidence of an aneurysm.
Note is made of a trifurcation of the anterior cerebral arteries, an anatomic variant.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:
Multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional reformatted images were essential for evaluating the arterial anatomy.
The following preliminary report was provided by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] on 
[**2136-2-3**]:
Acute hemorrhage filling the ventricular system.
Right frontal drain with tip at the medial aspect of the left lateral ventricle.
Suprasellar and quadrigeminal plate cisterns not well visualized, suggesting uncal/transtentorial herniation.
No intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen.
CTA: No definite aneurysm identified.
Likely right middle cerebral artery infundibulum.
IMPRESSION:
1.
Massive intraventricular hemorrhage, possibly originating from a parenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, with blood extending into the basal cisterns.
2.
Diffuse hydrocephalus.
3.
Diffuse brain edema with bilateral subfalcine and uncal herniation.
4.
No evidence of a vascular malformation or aneurysm.
2-mm infundibulum at the origin of the right temporal polar branch of the right middle cerebral artery.
CT C-SPINE:
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute fracture.  
There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis, possibly secondary to patient positioning within the collar.  
Evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited by endotracheal tube.  
CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable to MR, however, the thecal sac appears grossly intact.  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute fracture seen.  
Loss of normal cervical lordosis, possibly secondary to patient positioning.
CXR:
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:
Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  
A nasogastric tube descends below the diaphragm with the tip in the proximal stomach.  
The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal.  
The hazy fullness of the hila bilaterally, and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggest small volume overload.  
There are no consolidations or effusions.  
There is no pneumothorax.  
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Endotracheal tube in good position.  
Mild volume overload.
EKG:
afib, no acute changes
Somatosensory Evoked Potential UE
[**2136-2-14**]:
MEDIAN NERVE
SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED POTENTIAL (07-
023):
N9, N13, N19, N22, [**9-13**] 
interval,
[**9-19**] interval, [**9-22**]
interval, 13-
19 interval on both sides.
There was an N19-P22 amplitude.
IMPRESSION:
The waveforms on stimulation from the left appeared to be of normal contour and normal latency and normal interpeak latencies. 
The waveforms on stimulation of the right median nerve were more
distorted, particularly at the cortical level.
The interval latencies for N9-P22 and for N13-N19 were prolonged suggesting delay in the more thalamo-cortical projections and at the level of the thalamus itself. 
This is suggestive of disruption of neuronal pathways at those levels. 
It is relatively mild and is in keeping with lesions such as white matter bleeds which dissect rather than cut pathways.
The activity on the stimulation on the left side appeared to be within normal limits.
MRI/MRA brain
[**2136-2-18**]
: There are subacute blood products visualized within the ventricles bilaterally.
Low signal is seen along the margins of the ventricles indicating early hemosiderin deposition.
There is moderate ventriculomegaly which is unchanged from the previous CT examination.
Diffuse periventricular hyperintensities on FLAIR and T2 images indicate periventricular edema.
The fourth ventricle is normal in size. 
There is slight prominence of the third ventricle.
There is evidence of increased signal along the convexity sulci indicating blood products.
There is a right frontal ventricular drain tract identified.
There is no acute infarct seen.
There is no midline shift identified.
There is mild mucosal thickening seen in the right maxillary sinus.
Small amount of retained secretions are seen in the nasopharynx.
IMPRESSION:
Intraventricular hemorrhage with periventricular edema.
The blood products have further evolved since the earlier CT examination of
[**2136-2-4**] and
only slightly changed from the recent CT of
[**2136-2-4**].
The ventricular size has also not significantly changed.
No evidence of acute infarct.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old woman with afib on coumadin presented with a massive intraventricular hemorrhage, with evidence of herniation.
The etiology was likely hypertension in the setting of supratherapeutic anticoagulation.
No aneurysm was identified, and the majority of the blood was intraventricular, rather than subarachnoid.
Per Neurosurgery, no neurosurgical intervention was possible.  
It was explained to the family that she had a grave prognosis.
Nevertheless, they wished that she be "full code" and receive every possible intervention, including antibiotics, medications for ICP, pressors, and CPR.  
Hence we proceeded with full medical supportive care.
NEURO:
Patient was admitted to the NeuroICU.  
One hour neurochecks and repeat head CT 12 hours was unchanged.  
She was continued on mannitol, ventilation goal PaCO2 >35 and continued serial neuro checks.  
Repeat Head CT on
[**2-14**]
showed some improvement of hydrocephalus, stable massive IVH and slightly improved cerebral edema.  
Somatosensory evoked potential was also performed.  
Please see pertinent results for detail but was essentially equivocal regarding prognosis.  
MRI/A brain was also performed that did not show signficant damage such as loss of [**
Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
Patient's neurologic exam remained stable during hospital course.  
After discontinuation of sedation, exam was notable for the follow: Does not arouse to sternal rubs or voice. 
Spontaneously opens and closes eyes which are midline fixed. 
Does not follow commands, regards or vocalize.  
Anisicoria with left pupil 1mm larger then the right, both reactive to light. 
Spontaneously blinks, inconsistently to threat.  
Doll's eyes were present with horizontal OCM as well as corneals bilaterally.  
No grimace with nasal tickle, just torso squirming indicating indiscomfort.  
Decerebrate posturing in the arms and triple flexion in the legs.  
Rare spontaneous movement. 
Reflexes are 2+ brisk and toes are upgoing bilaterally.
At time of discharge, it was reiterated to the family that recovery to a significant level of function would be very unlikely given her neurologic exam and its lack of improvement. 
Family expressed that they understood and patient was transferred to rehab for further care.  
Could readdress resuming ASA if status improves.
CV:
Kept SBP<160 and MAP<130 and beta blockade for rate control.  
Ruled out for myocardial infarction and she remained in atrial fibrillation on cardiac telemetry during her hospital stay. 
Some fluid overload as evidenced by physical exam (edema) and some pulmonary congestion.  
Should keep fluid goal even daily with PRN lasix as needed.
Pulm:
Patient required prolonged intubation due to development of a ventilator associated pneumonia which was treated with a coarse of Zosyn 1 week.  
She then underwent tracheostomy placement and was eventually weaned to trach mask.  
She again developed a hospital acquired pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for a 10 day coarse until
[**2136-2-28**].  
Would continue Fluconazole until
[**2136-2-28**].
ID:
Please see pulm above.  
Patient had candiduria and fluconazole was started as treatment.  
Patient had persistent fevers with negative blood cultures.  
She began to defervesce after reinitiation of antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn).

MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man with fall subdural bleed
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Looking to r/o posterior stroke with MRA/MRI brain.
Also would like MRI brain w/ gadolinium r/o brain mets, hx of jaw ca recurrence. 
MRI AND MRA BRAIN
INDICATION:
67-year-old man with fall and subdural hematoma. 
Rule out posterior stroke with MRI/MRA of the brain, rule out brain metastasis with history of jaw carcinoma recurrence.
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained following administration of
[**Hospital 3173**] gadolinium.
3D high-resolution time-of-flight sequence was performed.
No diffusion DWI or GRE sequences were performed.
COMPARISON:
Head MR
[**First Name (Titles) 27533**]
[**2142-8-2**].
BRAIN MR
[**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **]
CONTRAST: Right subdural hematoma has not appreciably changed in size since the previous examination. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood products are not definitely appreciated on this study due to limited examination.
There is an area of enhancement involving cortex and subcortical white matter of the right inferior temporal lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion on the previous examination.
There is an area of surrounding edema.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. 
The ventricles are normal in size.
BRAIN MRA:
As on the previous study, there is absent flow in most of the internal carotid artery, with a short segment flow in the supraclinoid left internal carotid artery.
There is collateral or retrograde filling from the segment through the anterior and posterior communicating arteries.
The anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries are patent.
The vertebral, basilar arteries are patent, with codominant vertebral arteries. 
Major branches of the basilar artery are patent.
IMPRESSION:
1.
Absent flow in the major part of the left internal carotid artery, with collateral or retrograde flow to a short supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery. 
Complete circle of
[**Location (un) 431**].
Patent ECA, MCA, and PCA and major branches.
Diffusion-weighted imaging was not performed.
2.
Area of enhancement in the right anterior temporal lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion seen on previous examination with surrounding edema.
This finding may reflect a post-traumatic etiology; however, underlying enhancing brain lesion cannot be entirely excluded.
Short-term two-week followup is recommended to document resolution of this finding.
3.
Unchanged right subdural hematoma.
4.
Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage not evaluated on this study, as gradient echo imaging was not performed.

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT
[**Month/Day/Year **]
CONTRAST: The scan is of limited diagnostic quality due to artifact from breathing during the examination.
Within these limitations, there are new bibasilar effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.
There has been improvement in the multifocal ill-defined consolidation in both lungs.
There is no significant intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are small filling defects in the branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery as well as branches of the bilateral lower lobe pulmonary arteries suggestive of subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
CT ABDOMEN POST-ADMINISTRATION OF
[**Month/Day/Year **]
CONTRAST:
There is free fluid present in the upper abdomen, particularly around the liver and spleen.
There is a gastrostomy tube seen in situ.
The abdominal images are compromised due to artifact from breathing.
Within these limitations, the visualized liver and spleen appear unremarkable.
The kidneys perfuse normally.
There is minimal thickening of the left adrenal gland.
The right adrenal gland and pancreas appear unremarkable.

[**Month/Day/Year **]
CONTRAST: The images are again compromised due to artifact from breathing. 
There is a filling defect in the right femoral vein likely a DVT.
There is a left- sided inguinal hernia containing loops of bowel within it.
There is a urinary catheter seen in the bladder with air likely representing recent bladder instrumentation
MUSCULOSKELETAL:
There are multiple left-sided rib fractures. 
Fractures are also present involving the left iliac
[**Doctor First Name 362**]
, the left superior pubic ramus and the left inferior pubic ramus. 
There may also be a fracture through the right iliac bone.
CONCLUSION:
The entire examination is suboptimal due to artifact from breathing throughout the examination.
1.
Interval development of bibasilar effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.
There are small filling defects in the branches of the right upper lobe and right and left lower lobe branches of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary emboli.
2.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason:
ischemic injury
[**Hospital 93**]
MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ischemic injury
INDICATION: Head trauma, status post fall.
COMPARISON: No previous brain MRI.
Head CT scans dated
[**7-31**] and [**2142-8-1**]
are available for correlation.
TECHNIQUE:
Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
FINDINGS:
There is a right subdural hygroma, measuring approximately 6 mm in maximal thickness, with small amount of subacute subdural hematoma layering posteriorly in its dependent portion (best seen on FLAIR images).
Subarachnoid blood is present in multiple sulci of the right cerebral hemisphere, and in a few sulci of the left cerebral hemisphere.
There are multiple small cortical foci of high signal on FLAIR and diffusion-weighted images in the superior medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, most consistent with hemorrhagic contusions.
There is an area of high T2 signal involving the cortex and subcortical white matter of the right inferior temporal lobe.
Due to its proximity to the mastoid air cells, this area is not well evaluated on gradient echo and diffusion-weighted images, and it is not clear whether blood products are present within this contusion.
There is a small linear focus of high T2 signal in the subcortical white matter of the posterior left frontal lobe, without any associated signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted or gradient echo images, which appears non-specific, and may or may not be related to the patient's trauma.
Small amount of blood is layering in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, left more than right.
The ventricles are normal in size.
The major vascular flow voids appear unremarkable.
The left frontal sinus, bilateral ethmoid air cells, and the nasal cavity have fluid signal.
There is moderate circumferential mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses, and mild circumferential mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
Multiple foci of soft tissue swelling are noted in the posterior scalp.
IMPRESSION:
1.
Small right subdural hygroma, which contains a small amount of posteriorly layering subacute blood products.
2.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the hemispheric sulci, right greater than left.
3.
Multiple small hemorrhagic contusions in the superior medial aspects of bilateral frontal and parietal lobes.
Larger right inferior temporal contusion, which may or may not be hemorrhagic.
4.
Intraventricular blood as before. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2142-7-31**] at 0813 hours.
HISTORY: Found down at base of stairs.
TECHNIQUE:
Serial transverse images were acquired sequentially through the brain and reconstructed at stacked 5 mm transverse sections.
Images were reconstructed utilizing bone and soft tissue window algorithms.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS:
There is a large subgaleal hematoma extending over the left frontal convexity with a large laceration extending to the skull surface.
No embedded radiopaque foreign bodies are identified.
Soft tissue swelling extends over the lateral aspect of the included left face superficial to the left zygoma and in the preseptal soft tissues.
There is a linear lucency extending over the left orbital roof which may represent a nondisplaced fracture.
Subcutaneous air in an extraconal distribution is identified, particularly medially.
There is possibly an inferior orbital wall fracture.
The globe itself is intact with lens in place.
The right orbit is unremarkable.
There is extensive opacification of the ethmoid air cells and near-complete opacification with a small amount of layering high-attenuation fluid around more chronic appearing mucosal thickening in the left maxillary antrum.
The right maxillary antrum demonstrates similar but less severe thick mucosa likely due to chronic sinusitis.
The mastoid air cells are clear.
The skull base is intact.
Intracranially, the ventricles are midline with no intraventricular hemorrhage identified.
There is layering subarachnoid hemorrhage over the right frontal convexity.
Two small punctate rounded hyperattenuated foci are noted in the right posterior temporal lobe likely due to contusions.
A small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage is also noted in the perimesencephalic cisterns posterior to the right colliculi.
No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke is noted.
IMPRESSION:
Small hemorrhagic contusions in the posterior right temporal lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the posterior right frontal lobe and perimesencephalic cistern.
No significant mass effect or intraventricular extension noted.
No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.
Question of possible nondisplaced fracture over the left orbital roof.
Likewise, the left inferior orbital wall or medial wall of the left maxillary sinus cannot be cleared of fracture definitively.
Consider detailed maxillofacial CT scan for further evaluation.
Review with the trauma team at time of initial interpretation.

.
Neurologic:
small head bleeds were stable on repeat CT and deemed non-operative by neurosurgery.  
He was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.  
He completed 10 days. 
Slowly, the patient's neurologic exam improved; he began following commands, moving all extremities, and communicating. 
At times he is still confused.  
Neurology did not feel this was event was caused by a stroke.  
His cervical c-spine CT was highly abnormal, but it was unclear what, if any of these findings were related to his trauma.  
An MRI of the C spine was performed and his neck was cleared by the ortho spine staff on 
[**2142-8-4**].  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] (neurosurgery) with a repeat head CT 6 weeks after fall.
He received an MRI of the brain w/ & w/o to r/o brain mets, no obvious mets were seen but could not be ruled out in the setting of brain contusion. .
Respiratory:
Patient was started on the ventillator in the ED. 
His trach was changed in the TSICU to a cuffed trach; he was bronched upon admission to the TSICU given the PNA on CT scan.

ADDENDUM:
The patient was tried again Lopressor 12.5 mg for tachycardia when he went up to 130 in atrial fibrillation and not thought to be secondary to agitation.  
He tolerated the Lopressor well without any drop in his blood pressure or bradycardia.  
The Lopressor should be titrated as tolerated. 
The patient also tolerated a pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 and 0; respectively.  
He should be tried on a tracheal cuff once he is out of
[**Hospital1 6405**].  
The patient should also try to be weaned off Ativan and oxycodone to get a true reflection of his mental status.  
However, he may still require these medications for agitation.
The patient was also noted to have supratherapeutic Dilantin level of 18 with an albumin of 2.2.  
His Dilantin is being held, to be restarted on
[**6-26**]
at 100 mg p.o.
three times per day.  
He is to have levels checked daily.
Finally, the patient should followup with his primary care physician (Dr.

History of Present Illness:
43 year old male with h/o DMII, HTN, Hyperlipidemia and recent nephrolithiasis who was admitted to 
[**Hospital1 18**] [**9-8**] with recurrent right flank pain and chest pain.
He was originally admitted to
[**Location (un) 8973**]
Hospital one week prior and found to have a right 8mm UPJ stone and 9mm lower pole stone in the kidney.  
He underwent right ureteral stent placement.  
He has continued to have right flank pain and hematuria and returned to the emergency
[****].
In the ED, he experienced a 3 hour episode of substernal chest pressure.  
He reports it started shortly after eating breakfast.
It was accompanied by nausea, which he feels may be related to the pain medication he was given.  
He also reports associated shortness of breath.
This resolved prior to the resolution of the chest pain.  
He denies pain radiation,vomiting or diaphoresis.
He has multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN, T2DM, fatty liver, and recent significant family stress.  
In addition, his ECGs are concerning for coronary ischemia given the dynamic changes with his episode of chest pressure.  
His troponin also elevated somewhat from his admission troponin, and on

MEDICAL CONDITION: 44 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for effusion POD 4 s/p cabg
Final Report FINDINGS:
Right middle lobe opacification with sharp lateral edge is again seen and stable since
[**2173-9-9**], possibly atelectasis versus fibrosis.
Slight reduction in retrocardiac opacification likely due to decrease in left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Stable postoperative mediastinal widening.
Stable moderate-to-large cardiac silhouette.
Hilar contours are normal.
IMPRESSION:
Decreased retrocardiac opacity likely due to decreased effusion and atelectasis.
Stable right mid lung opacification of unclear etiology may represent scarring. 
Consider chest CT to better evaluate when patient clinically appropriate.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old male who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**9-8**] with recurrent right flank pain and chest pain. 
Originally admitted to
[**Location (un) 8973**]
Hospital one week prior found to have a right 8mm UPJ stone and 9mm lower pole stone in the kidney.  
He underwent right ureteral stent placement.  
He has continued to have right flank pain and hematuria and returned to the emergency
[****]. 
In the ED, he experienced a 3 hour episode of substernal chest pressure.
His ECGs were concerning for coronary ischemia.  
His troponin was elevated somewhat on
[**9-13**]
he had a +Stress Test. 
Cardiac cath was performed on
[**9-14**].
Significant coronary artery disease was revealed.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for revascularization. 
He was brought to the operating room on
[**9-17**] for coronary artery bypass grafting. 
Please see operative report for details, in summary he had:
1.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the     aorta to the first diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the second obtuse marginal coronary artery; as well as reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery.
2.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting. 
His BYPASS TIME was 89 minutes with a CROSSCLAMP TIME of 74 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and post-operatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. 
He remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period.
On the day of surgery he woke neurologically intact and was extubated.
He required low dose Neosynephrine to support his blood pressure and stayed in the ICU on POD1.
All tubes lines nad drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. 
After his chest tubes were removed he developed white out of the left side and a chest tube was placed, it subsequently drained 1.5L of serosang fluid.
On POD 3 he was transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor.
Once on the stepdown floor he worked with the nursing and physical therapy staff to regain his strenghth and mobility.
The remainder of his post-operative course was uneventful. 
He was discharged home with services on POD6.
He is to follow up with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 3 weeks.

MRI Head
[**7-8**] 
Large heterogeneous, hemorrhagic right parietal mass, without evidence of associated edema.
This appearance is compatible with an embryonal testicular carcinoma metastasis, though the absence of surrounding edema is unusual.
Other diagnostic considerations in a HIV-positive patient include lymphoma, particularly given the periventricular location, but the absence of associated edema is also atypical for lymphoma.
CT head
[**7-8**] 
Right parietal parenchymal lesion abutting the lateral ventricle, with probable surrounding edema (versus cystic components).
While this is concerning for a mass, infection is also possible, given the patient's immunocompromised status.
Recommend contrast-enhanced MRI for further evaluation.
CT head post op
[**7-8**]
1.
Large right frontal epidural hematoma and subdural hematoma with concern for active bleeding.
Transtentorial as well as subfalcine herniation with shift of normally midline structures measuring approximately 1.7 cm.
Edema within the right frontal and parietal lobe is also noted.
2.
Post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus and right parietal craniotomy.
CT head post epidural evacuation
1.
Decreased pneumocephalus
2.
Decreased shift from midline -
now 5mm, previously 9mm,
3.
Stable effacement of temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle
4.
No new hemorrhage
[**7-9**]
Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1.
Post-surgical changes consistent with hematoma evacuation, including partial craniectomy and extensive pneumocephalus.
Interval decrease in midline shift towards the left, now measuring 9 mm.
2.
Interval development of focal intraparenchymal small hemorrhages in the right frontal, parietal, and right cerebral convexity.
Close interval followups CT scanning is recommended.
[**7-10**]
Head CT:IMPRESSION: 1.
Slight increase in right frontal pneumocephalus.
2.
Persistent leftward shift of normally midline structures of approximately 6 mm.
3.
Focal parenchymal hemorrhages in the right frontal and parietal lobes, overall similar in appearance, with no significant new hemorrhage.
[**7-12**]
Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypodense areas in the right frontal and parietal lobes are more conspicuous than on prior study and more extensive in location than the prior mass. 
Another hypodense area on the anterior right frontal lobe is more defined.
This may represent edema, ischemia, infarct or tumor infiltration.  
Recommend MRI and follwo up(if not contra-indicated) for better assessment of these hypodense areas.
2.
Decreased pneumocephalus.
3.
Stable leftward shift from normally midline structures
[**7-13**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Since the previous CT of [**2125-3-1**] 
both the intracranial pressure monitoring device has been removed.
There is craniectomy with multiple hypodensities in the right cerebral hemisphere unchanged from previous study with foci of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
[**7-14**]
Head MRI: IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive predominantly cortical infarcts are seen in the frontoparietal and occipital lobes. 
Given somewhat atypical vascular distribution, the infarcts could be venous rather than arterial in origin.
Petechial hemorrhages are identified within the infarcts.
2.
Status post craniotomy in the occipital region with resection of the previously seen enhancing mass.
Subtle enhancement remains in this region which could be postoperative in nature.
3. Craniectomy identified as seen on the previous CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-8**]
Pt is a 33m with previous history of testicular cancer s/p orchiectomy and chemotherapy.
He was intially diagnosed with this in
[**2114**] and had his procedure at that time.
Pt has complained of 2 weeks of headaches that have become progressively worse over the last 3 days.
CT of the head upon admission showed a right parietal mass with surronding vasogenic edema.
There was minimal midline shift and no hydrocephalus.
MRI +/- contrast showed an enhancing mass within the right parietal lobe and the plan was for open biopsy on Monday
[**7-9**].
[**7-9**]
Pt taken to the OR for R parietal craniotomy on this day. 
Post operatively the patient was unable to extubate and was not waking up after anesthesia.
The patient was immediately taken for CT of the head.
Head CT showed large right sided epidural hematoma anterior to the resection cavity with 1.7cm of midline shift.
Pt was taken back to the operating room from CT scan and underwent emergent evacuation of epidural hematoma and R hemicraniectomy.
An ICP monitor was placed at the time of surgery to further monitor intracranial pressures.   
Pt was transfered to the ICU and remained intubated and sedated.
A head ct obtained showed good evacuation of hematoma, resolution of midline shift and no hyrdocephalus.
[**7-10**]
Head ct was stable with no new hemorrhage.
His baseline exam on this day showed no eye opening, PERRLA, withdraw BLE R>L, flexion RUE, extensor posturing LUE, no eye opening.
On the evening of
[**7-10**]
Pt's ICP's began to increase into the mid 20's where they had previously been
[**7-15**].
He was intially started on mannitol 25g IV q6 but this had little effect of lowering ICP. 
Pt was given an additional dose of 50g IV and ICP returned to a normal range.
Stat head ct showed no change when compared to previous exam.
[**7-11**]
Pt ICP continued to increase on this day and consistently within range of 25-
27.
Pt was treated with a one time bolus of 23% sodium chloride and was continued on mannitol 50g IVq6.
His ICP did decrease to a range of 20-
21.
His exam on this day remained unchanged as did his ct head.
[**7-12**]
Pt cont on mannitol and decadron, neurological exam & ICP's remained stable.
tumor markers were sent by the oncology team. 
8/13 ICP bolt was removed without difficulty.
Vancomycin was discontinued.
Mannitol wean was initiated. 
[**7-14**]
neurologically stable 
[**7-15**] Family meeting with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Family decided to proceed with Trach/Peg/IVC Filter [**Date range (1) 57944**]:

Pt more readily following commands on right side of body.
Decadron wean initiated on
[**7-17**] when mannitol was completely off. 
Tracheostomy, PEG and IVC filter placed on
[**7-17**]
without complications.
Tube feeds started on
[**7-18**] and tolerated well. 
[**7-19**]
CT head obtained for routine evaluation.
No new changes when compared to prior exams.
Pt was transfered to the step down unit on this day.
Pt eyes open to noxious and following commands on the right side.
Minimal movement in LUE to deep noxious, no movement of LLE. 
[**7-20**]
Pt noted to be febrile on this day with an increasing WBC count and increased amounts thick secretions requiring deep suction.
Sputum cultures sent and positive for H. Flu.
Pt was started on levaquin. 
[**Date range (1) 35200**]
ID team consulted and recommended to discontinue levaquin and start vancomycin and ceftazadime for broad spectrum coverage.
ID team recommended a 7 day course of these antibiotics.
A PICC line was obtained for continued IV therapy. 
His WBC count continued to trend down from 17.3 to 10.5 and he remained afebrile.
Pt random vancomycin level on
[**7-23**]
was 6.7 
and he was continued with his dosing of 1g IV q8.
A trough level on
[**7-24**]
was 14.3.
On
[**7-25**]
it was noted that his LFTs were slightly elevated on the date that Ceftaz was initiated.  
It was decided to d/c the Ceftaz and continue with Meropenum and Vanc.  
His RUE was noted to be slightly swollen when compared to the LUE.  
A subsequent RUE UE revealed a superficial clot.
NSAIDs and warm packs were given.
On
[**7-26**] he was given a bed a [**Hospital3 **].  
His final labs were unremarkable, and his head CT was grossly unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-10-5**]
Intraop TEE: PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal.
A PFO is not clearly seen but can not be comp-letely ruled out.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is effacement of the sino-tubular junction.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS There is normal biventricular systolic function. 
There is a stentless bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
It appears well seated and the leaflets can be seen to be moving normally.
There is trace central valvular regurgitation.
The maximum pressure gradient through the valve is 22 mmHg with a mean pressure of 9 mmHg at a cardiac output of 4.8 l/m.
There is now moderate tricuspid regurgitation in comparison to trace in the pre-bypass exam.
The reason for this change can not be ascertained.
The ascending aortic graft can not be well seen. 
The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta appear intact after decannulation.
No other significant changes from the pre-bypass exam.
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on
[**2142-10-5**] where the patient underwent Bentall procedure (including 27mm aortic tissue valve) with hemiarch replacement.  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. 
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  
He did develop thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 63,000.  
Heparin dependent antibody screen would return negative.  
He did develop post-operative atrial fibrillation and this was managed with amiodarone and coumadin as well as titration of beta blocker and calcium channel blocker as tolerated for optimal rate control. 
EP was consulted and recommended acceptable resting heart rate of less than 120.  
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  
INR was supratherapeutic at 4.0 and discharge to rehab was held one day.  
By the time of discharge on POD 9, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  
The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital 38**] rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  
INR should be checked Monday,
[**2142-10-15**].
